2: ACT I
3: PROLOGUE

5:     Two households, both alike in dignity,
6:     In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
7:     From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
8:     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
9:     From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
10:    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
11:    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
12:    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
13:    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
14:    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
15:    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
16:    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
17:    The which if you with patient ears attend,
18:    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

20:SCENE I. Verona. A public place.

22:    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers 

24:SAMPSON

26:    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

28:GREGORY

30:    No, for then we should be colliers.

32:SAMPSON

34:    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

36:GREGORY

38:    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

40:SAMPSON

42:    I strike quickly, being moved.

44:GREGORY

46:    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

48:SAMPSON

50:    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

52:GREGORY

54:    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
55:    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

57:SAMPSON

59:    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
60:    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

62:GREGORY

64:    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
65:    to the wall.

67:SAMPSON

69:    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
70:    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
71:    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
72:    to the wall.

74:GREGORY

76:    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

78:SAMPSON

80:    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
81:    have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
82:    maids, and cut off their heads.

84:GREGORY

86:    The heads of the maids?

88:SAMPSON

90:    Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
91:    take it in what sense thou wilt.

93:GREGORY

95:    They must take it in sense that feel it.

97:SAMPSON

99:    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
100:    'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

102:GREGORY

104:    'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
105:    hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
106:    two of the house of the Montagues.

108:SAMPSON

110:    My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

112:GREGORY

114:    How! turn thy back and run?

116:SAMPSON

118:    Fear me not.

120:GREGORY

122:    No, marry; I fear thee!

124:SAMPSON

126:    Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

128:GREGORY

130:    I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
131:    they list.

133:SAMPSON

135:    Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
136:    which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

138:    Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR

140:ABRAHAM

142:    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

144:SAMPSON

146:    I do bite my thumb, sir.

148:ABRAHAM

150:    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

152:SAMPSON

154:    [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
155:    ay?

157:GREGORY

159:    No.

161:SAMPSON

163:    No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
164:    bite my thumb, sir.

166:GREGORY

168:    Do you quarrel, sir?

170:ABRAHAM

172:    Quarrel sir! no, sir.

174:SAMPSON

176:    If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

178:ABRAHAM

180:    No better.

182:SAMPSON

184:    Well, sir.

186:GREGORY

188:    Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

190:SAMPSON

192:    Yes, better, sir.

194:ABRAHAM

196:    You lie.

198:SAMPSON

200:    Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

202:    They fight

204:    Enter BENVOLIO

206:BENVOLIO

208:    Part, fools!
209:    Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

211:    Beats down their swords

213:    Enter TYBALT

215:TYBALT

217:    What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
218:    Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

220:BENVOLIO

222:    I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
223:    Or manage it to part these men with me.

225:TYBALT

227:    What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
228:    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
229:    Have at thee, coward!

231:    They fight

233:    Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

235:First Citizen

237:    Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
238:    Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

240:    Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

242:CAPULET

244:    What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

246:LADY CAPULET

248:    A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

250:CAPULET

252:    My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
253:    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

255:    Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

257:MONTAGUE

259:    Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

261:LADY MONTAGUE

263:    Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

265:    Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

267:PRINCE

269:    Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
270:    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
271:    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
272:    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
273:    With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
274:    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
275:    Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
276:    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
277:    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
278:    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
279:    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
280:    And made Verona's ancient citizens
281:    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
282:    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
283:    Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
284:    If ever you disturb our streets again,
285:    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
286:    For this time, all the rest depart away:
287:    You Capulet; shall go along with me:
288:    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
289:    To know our further pleasure in this case,
290:    To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
291:    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

293:    Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

295:MONTAGUE

297:    Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
298:    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

300:BENVOLIO

302:    Here were the servants of your adversary,
303:    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
304:    I drew to part them: in the instant came
305:    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
306:    Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
307:    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
308:    Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
309:    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
310:    Came more and more and fought on part and part,
311:    Till the prince came, who parted either part.

313:LADY MONTAGUE

315:    O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
316:    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

318:BENVOLIO

320:    Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
321:    Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
322:    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
323:    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
324:    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
325:    So early walking did I see your son:
326:    Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
327:    And stole into the covert of the wood:
328:    I, measuring his affections by my own,
329:    That most are busied when they're most alone,
330:    Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
331:    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

333:MONTAGUE

335:    Many a morning hath he there been seen,
336:    With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
337:    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
338:    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
339:    Should in the furthest east begin to draw
340:    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
341:    Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
342:    And private in his chamber pens himself,
343:    Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
344:    And makes himself an artificial night:
345:    Black and portentous must this humour prove,
346:    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

348:BENVOLIO

350:    My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

352:MONTAGUE

354:    I neither know it nor can learn of him.

356:BENVOLIO

358:    Have you importuned him by any means?

360:MONTAGUE

362:    Both by myself and many other friends:
363:    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
364:    Is to himself--I will not say how true--
365:    But to himself so secret and so close,
366:    So far from sounding and discovery,
367:    As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
368:    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
369:    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
370:    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
371:    We would as willingly give cure as know.

373:    Enter ROMEO

375:BENVOLIO

377:    See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
378:    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

380:MONTAGUE

382:    I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
383:    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

385:    Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

387:BENVOLIO

389:    Good-morrow, cousin.

391:ROMEO

393:    Is the day so young?

395:BENVOLIO

397:    But new struck nine.

399:ROMEO

401:    Ay me! sad hours seem long.
402:    Was that my father that went hence so fast?

404:BENVOLIO

406:    It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

408:ROMEO

410:    Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

412:BENVOLIO

414:    In love?

416:ROMEO

418:    Out--

420:BENVOLIO

422:    Of love?

424:ROMEO

426:    Out of her favour, where I am in love.

428:BENVOLIO

430:    Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
431:    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

433:ROMEO

435:    Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
436:    Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
437:    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
438:    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
439:    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
440:    Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
441:    O any thing, of nothing first create!
442:    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
443:    Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
444:    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
445:    sick health!
446:    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
447:    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
448:    Dost thou not laugh?

450:BENVOLIO

452:    No, coz, I rather weep.

454:ROMEO

456:    Good heart, at what?

458:BENVOLIO

460:    At thy good heart's oppression.

462:ROMEO

464:    Why, such is love's transgression.
465:    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
466:    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
467:    With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
468:    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
469:    Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
470:    Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
471:    Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
472:    What is it else? a madness most discreet,
473:    A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
474:    Farewell, my coz.

476:BENVOLIO

478:    Soft! I will go along;
479:    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

481:ROMEO

483:    Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
484:    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

486:BENVOLIO

488:    Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

490:ROMEO

492:    What, shall I groan and tell thee?

494:BENVOLIO

496:    Groan! why, no.
497:    But sadly tell me who.

499:ROMEO

501:    Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
502:    Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
503:    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

505:BENVOLIO

507:    I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

509:ROMEO

511:    A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

513:BENVOLIO

515:    A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

517:ROMEO

519:    Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
520:    With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
521:    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
522:    From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
523:    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
524:    Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
525:    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
526:    O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
527:    That when she dies with beauty dies her store.

529:BENVOLIO

531:    Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

533:ROMEO

535:    She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
536:    For beauty starved with her severity
537:    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
538:    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
539:    To merit bliss by making me despair:
540:    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
541:    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

543:BENVOLIO

545:    Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

547:ROMEO

549:    O, teach me how I should forget to think.

551:BENVOLIO

553:    By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
554:    Examine other beauties.

556:ROMEO

558:    'Tis the way
559:    To call hers exquisite, in question more:
560:    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
561:    Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
562:    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
563:    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
564:    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
565:    What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
566:    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
567:    Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

569:BENVOLIO

571:    I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

573:    Exeunt

575:SCENE II. A street.

577:    Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant 

579:CAPULET

581:    But Montague is bound as well as I,
582:    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
583:    For men so old as we to keep the peace.

585:PARIS

587:    Of honourable reckoning are you both;
588:    And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
589:    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

591:CAPULET

593:    But saying o'er what I have said before:
594:    My child is yet a stranger in the world;
595:    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
596:    Let two more summers wither in their pride,
597:    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

599:PARIS

601:    Younger than she are happy mothers made.

603:CAPULET

605:    And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
606:    The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
607:    She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
608:    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
609:    My will to her consent is but a part;
610:    An she agree, within her scope of choice
611:    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
612:    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
613:    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
614:    Such as I love; and you, among the store,
615:    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
616:    At my poor house look to behold this night
617:    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
618:    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
619:    When well-apparell'd April on the heel
620:    Of limping winter treads, even such delight
621:    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
622:    Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
623:    And like her most whose merit most shall be:
624:    Which on more view, of many mine being one
625:    May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
626:    Come, go with me.

628:    To Servant, giving a paper
629:    Go, sirrah, trudge about
630:    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
631:    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
632:    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

634:    Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS

636:Servant

638:    Find them out whose names are written here! It is
639:    written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
640:    yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
641:    his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
642:    sent to find those persons whose names are here
643:    writ, and can never find what names the writing
644:    person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

646:    Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO

648:BENVOLIO

650:    Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
651:    One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
652:    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
653:    One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
654:    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
655:    And the rank poison of the old will die.

657:ROMEO

659:    Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

661:BENVOLIO

663:    For what, I pray thee?

665:ROMEO

667:    For your broken shin.

669:BENVOLIO

671:    Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

673:ROMEO

675:    Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
676:    Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
677:    Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

679:Servant

681:    God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

683:ROMEO

685:    Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

687:Servant

689:    Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
690:    pray, can you read any thing you see?

692:ROMEO

694:    Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

696:Servant

698:    Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

700:ROMEO

702:    Stay, fellow; I can read.

704:    Reads
705:    'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
706:    County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
707:    widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
708:    nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
709:    uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
710:    Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
711:    Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
712:    assembly: whither should they come?

714:Servant

716:    Up.

718:ROMEO

720:    Whither?

722:Servant

724:    To supper; to our house.

726:ROMEO

728:    Whose house?

730:Servant

732:    My master's.

734:ROMEO

736:    Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

738:Servant

740:    Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
741:    great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
742:    of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
743:    Rest you merry!

745:    Exit

747:BENVOLIO

749:    At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
750:    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
751:    With all the admired beauties of Verona:
752:    Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
753:    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
754:    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

756:ROMEO

758:    When the devout religion of mine eye
759:    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
760:    And these, who often drown'd could never die,
761:    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
762:    One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
763:    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

765:BENVOLIO

767:    Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
768:    Herself poised with herself in either eye:
769:    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
770:    Your lady's love against some other maid
771:    That I will show you shining at this feast,
772:    And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

774:ROMEO

776:    I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
777:    But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

779:    Exeunt

781:SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.

783:    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse 

785:LADY CAPULET

787:    Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

789:Nurse

791:    Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
792:    I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
793:    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

795:    Enter JULIET

797:JULIET

799:    How now! who calls?

801:Nurse

803:    Your mother.

805:JULIET

807:    Madam, I am here.
808:    What is your will?

810:LADY CAPULET

812:    This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
813:    We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
814:    I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
815:    Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

817:Nurse

819:    Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

821:LADY CAPULET

823:    She's not fourteen.

825:Nurse

827:    I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
828:    And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
829:    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
830:    To Lammas-tide?

832:LADY CAPULET

834:    A fortnight and odd days.

836:Nurse

838:    Even or odd, of all days in the year,
839:    Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
840:    Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
841:    Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
842:    She was too good for me: but, as I said,
843:    On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
844:    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
845:    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
846:    And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
847:    Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
848:    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
849:    Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
850:    My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
851:    Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
852:    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
853:    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
854:    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
855:    Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
856:    To bid me trudge:
857:    And since that time it is eleven years;
858:    For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
859:    She could have run and waddled all about;
860:    For even the day before, she broke her brow:
861:    And then my husband--God be with his soul!
862:    A' was a merry man--took up the child:
863:    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
864:    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
865:    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
866:    The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
867:    To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
868:    I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
869:    I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
870:    And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

872:LADY CAPULET

874:    Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

876:Nurse

878:    Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
879:    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
880:    And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
881:    A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
882:    A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
883:    'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
884:    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
885:    Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

887:JULIET

889:    And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

891:Nurse

893:    Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
894:    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
895:    An I might live to see thee married once,
896:    I have my wish.

898:LADY CAPULET

900:    Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
901:    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
902:    How stands your disposition to be married?

904:JULIET

906:    It is an honour that I dream not of.

908:Nurse

910:    An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
911:    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

913:LADY CAPULET

915:    Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
916:    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
917:    Are made already mothers: by my count,
918:    I was your mother much upon these years
919:    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
920:    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

922:Nurse

924:    A man, young lady! lady, such a man
925:    As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

927:LADY CAPULET

929:    Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

931:Nurse

933:    Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

935:LADY CAPULET

937:    What say you? can you love the gentleman?
938:    This night you shall behold him at our feast;
939:    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
940:    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
941:    Examine every married lineament,
942:    And see how one another lends content
943:    And what obscured in this fair volume lies
944:    Find written in the margent of his eyes.
945:    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
946:    To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
947:    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
948:    For fair without the fair within to hide:
949:    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
950:    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
951:    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
952:    By having him, making yourself no less.

954:Nurse

956:    No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

958:LADY CAPULET

960:    Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

962:JULIET

964:    I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
965:    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
966:    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

968:    Enter a Servant

970:Servant

972:    Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
973:    called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
974:    the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
975:    hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

977:LADY CAPULET

979:    We follow thee.

981:    Exit Servant
982:    Juliet, the county stays.

984:Nurse

986:    Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

988:    Exeunt

990:SCENE IV. A street.

992:    Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others 

994:ROMEO

996:    What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
997:    Or shall we on without a apology?

999:BENVOLIO

1001:    The date is out of such prolixity:
1002:    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
1003:    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
1004:    Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
1005:    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
1006:    After the prompter, for our entrance:
1007:    But let them measure us by what they will;
1008:    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

1010:ROMEO

1012:    Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
1013:    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

1015:MERCUTIO

1017:    Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

1019:ROMEO

1021:    Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
1022:    With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
1023:    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

1025:MERCUTIO

1027:    You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
1028:    And soar with them above a common bound.

1030:ROMEO

1032:    I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
1033:    To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
1034:    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
1035:    Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

1037:MERCUTIO

1039:    And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
1040:    Too great oppression for a tender thing.

1042:ROMEO

1044:    Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
1045:    Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

1047:MERCUTIO

1049:    If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
1050:    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
1051:    Give me a case to put my visage in:
1052:    A visor for a visor! what care I
1053:    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
1054:    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

1056:BENVOLIO

1058:    Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
1059:    But every man betake him to his legs.

1061:ROMEO

1063:    A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
1064:    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
1065:    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
1066:    I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
1067:    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

1069:MERCUTIO

1071:    Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
1072:    If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
1073:    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
1074:    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

1076:ROMEO

1078:    Nay, that's not so.

1080:MERCUTIO

1082:    I mean, sir, in delay
1083:    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
1084:    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
1085:    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

1087:ROMEO

1089:    And we mean well in going to this mask;
1090:    But 'tis no wit to go.

1092:MERCUTIO

1094:    Why, may one ask?

1096:ROMEO

1098:    I dream'd a dream to-night.

1100:MERCUTIO

1102:    And so did I.

1104:ROMEO

1106:    Well, what was yours?

1108:MERCUTIO

1110:    That dreamers often lie.

1112:ROMEO

1114:    In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

1116:MERCUTIO

1118:    O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
1119:    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
1120:    In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
1121:    On the fore-finger of an alderman,
1122:    Drawn with a team of little atomies
1123:    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
1124:    Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
1125:    The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
1126:    The traces of the smallest spider's web,
1127:    The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
1128:    Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
1129:    Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
1130:    Not so big as a round little worm
1131:    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
1132:    Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
1133:    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
1134:    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
1135:    And in this state she gallops night by night
1136:    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
1137:    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
1138:    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
1139:    O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
1140:    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
1141:    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
1142:    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
1143:    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
1144:    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
1145:    Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
1146:    Then dreams, he of another benefice:
1147:    Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
1148:    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
1149:    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
1150:    Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
1151:    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
1152:    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
1153:    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
1154:    That plats the manes of horses in the night,
1155:    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
1156:    Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
1157:    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
1158:    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
1159:    Making them women of good carriage:
1160:    This is she--

1162:ROMEO

1164:    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
1165:    Thou talk'st of nothing.

1167:MERCUTIO

1169:    True, I talk of dreams,
1170:    Which are the children of an idle brain,
1171:    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
1172:    Which is as thin of substance as the air
1173:    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
1174:    Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
1175:    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
1176:    Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

1178:BENVOLIO

1180:    This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
1181:    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

1183:ROMEO

1185:    I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
1186:    Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
1187:    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
1188:    With this night's revels and expire the term
1189:    Of a despised life closed in my breast
1190:    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
1191:    But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
1192:    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

1194:BENVOLIO

1196:    Strike, drum.

1198:    Exeunt

1200:SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.

1202:    Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins 

1204:First Servant

1206:    Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
1207:    shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

1209:Second Servant

1211:    When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
1212:    hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

1214:First Servant

1216:    Away with the joint-stools, remove the
1217:    court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
1218:    me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
1219:    the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
1220:    Antony, and Potpan!

1222:Second Servant

1224:    Ay, boy, ready.

1226:First Servant

1228:    You are looked for and called for, asked for and
1229:    sought for, in the great chamber.

1231:Second Servant

1233:    We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
1234:    brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

1236:    Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers

1238:CAPULET

1240:    Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
1241:    Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
1242:    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
1243:    Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
1244:    She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
1245:    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
1246:    That I have worn a visor and could tell
1247:    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
1248:    Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
1249:    You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
1250:    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

1252:    Music plays, and they dance
1253:    More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
1254:    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
1255:    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
1256:    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
1257:    For you and I are past our dancing days:
1258:    How long is't now since last yourself and I
1259:    Were in a mask?

1261:Second Capulet

1263:    By'r lady, thirty years.

1265:CAPULET

1267:    What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
1268:    'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
1269:    Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
1270:    Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

1272:Second Capulet

1274:    'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
1275:    His son is thirty.

1277:CAPULET

1279:    Will you tell me that?
1280:    His son was but a ward two years ago.

1282:ROMEO

1284:    [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
1285:    enrich the hand
1286:    Of yonder knight?

1288:Servant

1290:    I know not, sir.

1292:ROMEO

1294:    O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
1295:    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
1296:    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
1297:    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
1298:    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
1299:    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
1300:    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
1301:    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
1302:    Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
1303:    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

1305:TYBALT

1307:    This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
1308:    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
1309:    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
1310:    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
1311:    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
1312:    To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

1314:CAPULET

1316:    Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

1318:TYBALT

1320:    Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
1321:    A villain that is hither come in spite,
1322:    To scorn at our solemnity this night.

1324:CAPULET

1326:    Young Romeo is it?

1328:TYBALT

1330:    'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

1332:CAPULET

1334:    Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
1335:    He bears him like a portly gentleman;
1336:    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
1337:    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
1338:    I would not for the wealth of all the town
1339:    Here in my house do him disparagement:
1340:    Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
1341:    It is my will, the which if thou respect,
1342:    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
1343:    And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

1345:TYBALT

1347:    It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
1348:    I'll not endure him.

1350:CAPULET

1352:    He shall be endured:
1353:    What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
1354:    Am I the master here, or you? go to.
1355:    You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
1356:    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
1357:    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

1359:TYBALT

1361:    Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

1363:CAPULET

1365:    Go to, go to;
1366:    You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
1367:    This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
1368:    You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
1369:    Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
1370:    Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
1371:    I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

1373:TYBALT

1375:    Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
1376:    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
1377:    I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
1378:    Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

1380:    Exit

1382:ROMEO

1384:    [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
1385:    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
1386:    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
1387:    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

1389:JULIET

1391:    Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
1392:    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
1393:    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
1394:    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

1396:ROMEO

1398:    Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

1400:JULIET

1402:    Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

1404:ROMEO

1406:    O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
1407:    They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

1409:JULIET

1411:    Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

1413:ROMEO

1415:    Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
1416:    Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

1418:JULIET

1420:    Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

1422:ROMEO

1424:    Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
1425:    Give me my sin again.

1427:JULIET

1429:    You kiss by the book.

1431:Nurse

1433:    Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

1435:ROMEO

1437:    What is her mother?

1439:Nurse

1441:    Marry, bachelor,
1442:    Her mother is the lady of the house,
1443:    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
1444:    I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
1445:    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
1446:    Shall have the chinks.

1448:ROMEO

1450:    Is she a Capulet?
1451:    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

1453:BENVOLIO

1455:    Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

1457:ROMEO

1459:    Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

1461:CAPULET

1463:    Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
1464:    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
1465:    Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
1466:    I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
1467:    More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
1468:    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
1469:    I'll to my rest.

1471:    Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse

1473:JULIET

1475:    Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

1477:Nurse

1479:    The son and heir of old Tiberio.

1481:JULIET

1483:    What's he that now is going out of door?

1485:Nurse

1487:    Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

1489:JULIET

1491:    What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

1493:Nurse

1495:    I know not.

1497:JULIET

1499:    Go ask his name: if he be married.
1500:    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

1502:Nurse

1504:    His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1505:    The only son of your great enemy.

1507:JULIET

1509:    My only love sprung from my only hate!
1510:    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1511:    Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1512:    That I must love a loathed enemy.

1514:Nurse

1516:    What's this? what's this?

1518:JULIET

1520:    A rhyme I learn'd even now
1521:    Of one I danced withal.

1523:    One calls within 'Juliet.'

1525:Nurse

1527:    Anon, anon!
1528:    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

1530:    Exeunt

1532:ACT II
1533:PROLOGUE

1535:    Enter Chorus 

1537:Chorus

1539:    Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1540:    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1541:    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1542:    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1543:    Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1544:    Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1545:    But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1546:    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1547:    Being held a foe, he may not have access
1548:    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1549:    And she as much in love, her means much less
1550:    To meet her new-beloved any where:
1551:    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1552:    Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

1554:    Exit

1556:SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.

1558:    Enter ROMEO 

1560:ROMEO

1562:    Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1563:    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

1565:    He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it

1567:    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

1569:BENVOLIO

1571:    Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

1573:MERCUTIO

1575:    He is wise;
1576:    And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.

1578:BENVOLIO

1580:    He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1581:    Call, good Mercutio.

1583:MERCUTIO

1585:    Nay, I'll conjure too.
1586:    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1587:    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1588:    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1589:    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1590:    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1591:    One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1592:    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1593:    When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1594:    He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1595:    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1596:    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1597:    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1598:    By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1599:    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1600:    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

1602:BENVOLIO

1604:    And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

1606:MERCUTIO

1608:    This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1609:    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1610:    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1611:    Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1612:    That were some spite: my invocation
1613:    Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
1614:    I conjure only but to raise up him.

1616:BENVOLIO

1618:    Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1619:    To be consorted with the humorous night:
1620:    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

1622:MERCUTIO

1624:    If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1625:    Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1626:    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1627:    As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1628:    Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1629:    An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1630:    Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1631:    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1632:    Come, shall we go?

1634:BENVOLIO

1636:    Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1637:    To seek him here that means not to be found.

1639:    Exeunt

1641:SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

1643:    Enter ROMEO 

1645:ROMEO

1647:    He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

1649:    JULIET appears above at a window
1650:    But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1651:    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1652:    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1653:    Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1654:    That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1655:    Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1656:    Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1657:    And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1658:    It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1659:    O, that she knew she were!
1660:    She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1661:    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1662:    I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1663:    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1664:    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1665:    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1666:    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1667:    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1668:    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1669:    Would through the airy region stream so bright
1670:    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1671:    See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1672:    O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1673:    That I might touch that cheek!

1675:JULIET

1677:    Ay me!

1679:ROMEO

1681:    She speaks:
1682:    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1683:    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1684:    As is a winged messenger of heaven
1685:    Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1686:    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1687:    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1688:    And sails upon the bosom of the air.

1690:JULIET

1692:    O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1693:    Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1694:    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1695:    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

1697:ROMEO

1699:    [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

1701:JULIET

1703:    'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1704:    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1705:    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1706:    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1707:    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1708:    What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1709:    By any other name would smell as sweet;
1710:    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1711:    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1712:    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1713:    And for that name which is no part of thee
1714:    Take all myself.

1716:ROMEO

1718:    I take thee at thy word:
1719:    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1720:    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

1722:JULIET

1724:    What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1725:    So stumblest on my counsel?

1727:ROMEO

1729:    By a name
1730:    I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1731:    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1732:    Because it is an enemy to thee;
1733:    Had I it written, I would tear the word.

1735:JULIET

1737:    My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1738:    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1739:    Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

1741:ROMEO

1743:    Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

1745:JULIET

1747:    How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1748:    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1749:    And the place death, considering who thou art,
1750:    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

1752:ROMEO

1754:    With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1755:    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1756:    And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1757:    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

1759:JULIET

1761:    If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

1763:ROMEO

1765:    Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1766:    Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1767:    And I am proof against their enmity.

1769:JULIET

1771:    I would not for the world they saw thee here.

1773:ROMEO

1775:    I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1776:    And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1777:    My life were better ended by their hate,
1778:    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

1780:JULIET

1782:    By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

1784:ROMEO

1786:    By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1787:    He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1788:    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1789:    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1790:    I would adventure for such merchandise.

1792:JULIET

1794:    Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1795:    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1796:    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1797:    Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1798:    What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1799:    Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1800:    And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1801:    Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1802:    Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1803:    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1804:    Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1805:    I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1806:    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1807:    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1808:    And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1809:    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1810:    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1811:    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1812:    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1813:    My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1814:    And not impute this yielding to light love,
1815:    Which the dark night hath so discovered.

1817:ROMEO

1819:    Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1820:    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

1822:JULIET

1824:    O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1825:    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1826:    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

1828:ROMEO

1830:    What shall I swear by?

1832:JULIET

1834:    Do not swear at all;
1835:    Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1836:    Which is the god of my idolatry,
1837:    And I'll believe thee.

1839:ROMEO

1841:    If my heart's dear love--

1843:JULIET

1845:    Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1846:    I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1847:    It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1848:    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1849:    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1850:    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1851:    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1852:    Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1853:    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

1855:ROMEO

1857:    O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

1859:JULIET

1861:    What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

1863:ROMEO

1865:    The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

1867:JULIET

1869:    I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1870:    And yet I would it were to give again.

1872:ROMEO

1874:    Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

1876:JULIET

1878:    But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1879:    And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1880:    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1881:    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1882:    The more I have, for both are infinite.

1884:    Nurse calls within
1885:    I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1886:    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1887:    Stay but a little, I will come again.

1889:    Exit, above

1891:ROMEO

1893:    O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1894:    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1895:    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

1897:    Re-enter JULIET, above

1899:JULIET

1901:    Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1902:    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1903:    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1904:    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1905:    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1906:    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1907:    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

1909:Nurse

1911:    [Within] Madam!

1913:JULIET

1915:    I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1916:    I do beseech thee--

1918:Nurse

1920:    [Within] Madam!

1922:JULIET

1924:    By and by, I come:--
1925:    To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1926:    To-morrow will I send.

1928:ROMEO

1930:    So thrive my soul--

1932:JULIET

1934:    A thousand times good night!

1936:    Exit, above

1938:ROMEO

1940:    A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1941:    Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1942:    their books,
1943:    But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

1945:    Retiring

1947:    Re-enter JULIET, above

1949:JULIET

1951:    Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1952:    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1953:    Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1954:    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1955:    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1956:    With repetition of my Romeo's name.

1958:ROMEO

1960:    It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1961:    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1962:    Like softest music to attending ears!

1964:JULIET

1966:    Romeo!

1968:ROMEO

1970:    My dear?

1972:JULIET

1974:    At what o'clock to-morrow
1975:    Shall I send to thee?

1977:ROMEO

1979:    At the hour of nine.

1981:JULIET

1983:    I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1984:    I have forgot why I did call thee back.

1986:ROMEO

1988:    Let me stand here till thou remember it.

1990:JULIET

1992:    I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1993:    Remembering how I love thy company.

1995:ROMEO

1997:    And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1998:    Forgetting any other home but this.

2000:JULIET

2002:    'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
2003:    And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
2004:    Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
2005:    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
2006:    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
2007:    So loving-jealous of his liberty.

2009:ROMEO

2011:    I would I were thy bird.

2013:JULIET

2015:    Sweet, so would I:
2016:    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
2017:    Good night, good night! parting is such
2018:    sweet sorrow,
2019:    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

2021:    Exit above

2023:ROMEO

2025:    Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
2026:    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
2027:    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
2028:    His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

2030:    Exit

2032:SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.

2034:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket 

2036:FRIAR LAURENCE

2038:    The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
2039:    Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
2040:    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
2041:    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
2042:    Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
2043:    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
2044:    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
2045:    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
2046:    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
2047:    What is her burying grave that is her womb,
2048:    And from her womb children of divers kind
2049:    We sucking on her natural bosom find,
2050:    Many for many virtues excellent,
2051:    None but for some and yet all different.
2052:    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
2053:    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
2054:    For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
2055:    But to the earth some special good doth give,
2056:    Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
2057:    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
2058:    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
2059:    And vice sometimes by action dignified.
2060:    Within the infant rind of this small flower
2061:    Poison hath residence and medicine power:
2062:    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
2063:    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
2064:    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
2065:    In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
2066:    And where the worser is predominant,
2067:    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

2069:    Enter ROMEO

2071:ROMEO

2073:    Good morrow, father.

2075:FRIAR LAURENCE

2077:    Benedicite!
2078:    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
2079:    Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
2080:    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
2081:    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
2082:    And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
2083:    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
2084:    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
2085:    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
2086:    Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
2087:    Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
2088:    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

2090:ROMEO

2092:    That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

2094:FRIAR LAURENCE

2096:    God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

2098:ROMEO

2100:    With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
2101:    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

2103:FRIAR LAURENCE

2105:    That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?

2107:ROMEO

2109:    I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
2110:    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
2111:    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
2112:    That's by me wounded: both our remedies
2113:    Within thy help and holy physic lies:
2114:    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
2115:    My intercession likewise steads my foe.

2117:FRIAR LAURENCE

2119:    Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
2120:    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

2122:ROMEO

2124:    Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
2125:    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
2126:    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
2127:    And all combined, save what thou must combine
2128:    By holy marriage: when and where and how
2129:    We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
2130:    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
2131:    That thou consent to marry us to-day.

2133:FRIAR LAURENCE

2135:    Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
2136:    Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
2137:    So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
2138:    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
2139:    Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
2140:    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
2141:    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
2142:    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
2143:    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
2144:    Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
2145:    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
2146:    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
2147:    If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
2148:    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
2149:    And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
2150:    Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

2152:ROMEO

2154:    Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

2156:FRIAR LAURENCE

2158:    For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

2160:ROMEO

2162:    And bad'st me bury love.

2164:FRIAR LAURENCE

2166:    Not in a grave,
2167:    To lay one in, another out to have.

2169:ROMEO

2171:    I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
2172:    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
2173:    The other did not so.

2175:FRIAR LAURENCE

2177:    O, she knew well
2178:    Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
2179:    But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
2180:    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
2181:    For this alliance may so happy prove,
2182:    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

2184:ROMEO

2186:    O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

2188:FRIAR LAURENCE

2190:    Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

2192:    Exeunt

2194:SCENE IV. A street.

2196:    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO 

2198:MERCUTIO

2200:    Where the devil should this Romeo be?
2201:    Came he not home to-night?

2203:BENVOLIO

2205:    Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

2207:MERCUTIO

2209:    Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
2210:    Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

2212:BENVOLIO

2214:    Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
2215:    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

2217:MERCUTIO

2219:    A challenge, on my life.

2221:BENVOLIO

2223:    Romeo will answer it.

2225:MERCUTIO

2227:    Any man that can write may answer a letter.

2229:BENVOLIO

2231:    Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
2232:    dares, being dared.

2234:MERCUTIO

2236:    Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
2237:    white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
2238:    love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
2239:    blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
2240:    encounter Tybalt?

2242:BENVOLIO

2244:    Why, what is Tybalt?

2246:MERCUTIO

2248:    More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
2249:    the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
2250:    you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
2251:    proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
2252:    the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
2253:    button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
2254:    very first house, of the first and second cause:
2255:    ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
2256:    hai!

2258:BENVOLIO

2260:    The what?

2262:MERCUTIO

2264:    The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
2265:    fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
2266:    a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
2267:    whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
2268:    grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
2269:    these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
2270:    perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
2271:    that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
2272:    bones, their bones!

2274:    Enter ROMEO

2276:BENVOLIO

2278:    Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

2280:MERCUTIO

2282:    Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
2283:    how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
2284:    that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
2285:    kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
2286:    be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
2287:    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
2288:    eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
2289:    Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
2290:    to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
2291:    fairly last night.

2293:ROMEO

2295:    Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

2297:MERCUTIO

2299:    The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

2301:ROMEO

2303:    Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
2304:    such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

2306:MERCUTIO

2308:    That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
2309:    constrains a man to bow in the hams.

2311:ROMEO

2313:    Meaning, to court'sy.

2315:MERCUTIO

2317:    Thou hast most kindly hit it.

2319:ROMEO

2321:    A most courteous exposition.

2323:MERCUTIO

2325:    Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

2327:ROMEO

2329:    Pink for flower.

2331:MERCUTIO

2333:    Right.

2335:ROMEO

2337:    Why, then is my pump well flowered.

2339:MERCUTIO

2341:    Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
2342:    worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
2343:    is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.

2345:ROMEO

2347:    O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
2348:    singleness.

2350:MERCUTIO

2352:    Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

2354:ROMEO

2356:    Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

2358:MERCUTIO

2360:    Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
2361:    done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
2362:    thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
2363:    was I with you there for the goose?

2365:ROMEO

2367:    Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
2368:    not there for the goose.

2370:MERCUTIO

2372:    I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

2374:ROMEO

2376:    Nay, good goose, bite not.

2378:MERCUTIO

2380:    Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
2381:    sharp sauce.

2383:ROMEO

2385:    And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?

2387:MERCUTIO

2389:    O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
2390:    inch narrow to an ell broad!

2392:ROMEO

2394:    I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
2395:    to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

2397:MERCUTIO

2399:    Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
2400:    now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
2401:    thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
2402:    for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
2403:    that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

2405:BENVOLIO

2407:    Stop there, stop there.

2409:MERCUTIO

2411:    Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

2413:BENVOLIO

2415:    Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

2417:MERCUTIO

2419:    O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
2420:    for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
2421:    meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

2423:ROMEO

2425:    Here's goodly gear!

2427:    Enter Nurse and PETER

2429:MERCUTIO

2431:    A sail, a sail!

2433:BENVOLIO

2435:    Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

2437:Nurse

2439:    Peter!

2441:PETER

2443:    Anon!

2445:Nurse

2447:    My fan, Peter.

2449:MERCUTIO

2451:    Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
2452:    fairer face.

2454:Nurse

2456:    God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

2458:MERCUTIO

2460:    God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

2462:Nurse

2464:    Is it good den?

2466:MERCUTIO

2468:    'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
2469:    dial is now upon the prick of noon.

2471:Nurse

2473:    Out upon you! what a man are you!

2475:ROMEO

2477:    One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
2478:    mar.

2480:Nurse

2482:    By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
2483:    quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
2484:    may find the young Romeo?

2486:ROMEO

2488:    I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
2489:    you have found him than he was when you sought him:
2490:    I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

2492:Nurse

2494:    You say well.

2496:MERCUTIO

2498:    Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
2499:    wisely, wisely.

2501:Nurse

2503:    if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
2504:    you.

2506:BENVOLIO

2508:    She will indite him to some supper.

2510:MERCUTIO

2512:    A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

2514:ROMEO

2516:    What hast thou found?

2518:MERCUTIO

2520:    No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
2521:    that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.

2523:    Sings
2524:    An old hare hoar,
2525:    And an old hare hoar,
2526:    Is very good meat in lent
2527:    But a hare that is hoar
2528:    Is too much for a score,
2529:    When it hoars ere it be spent.
2530:    Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
2531:    to dinner, thither.

2533:ROMEO

2535:    I will follow you.

2537:MERCUTIO

2539:    Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,

2541:    Singing
2542:    'lady, lady, lady.'

2544:    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

2546:Nurse

2548:    Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
2549:    merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

2551:ROMEO

2553:    A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
2554:    and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
2555:    to in a month.

2557:Nurse

2559:    An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
2560:    down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
2561:    Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
2562:    Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
2563:    none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
2564:    too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

2566:PETER

2568:    I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
2569:    should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
2570:    draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
2571:    good quarrel, and the law on my side.

2573:Nurse

2575:    Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
2576:    me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
2577:    and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
2578:    out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
2579:    but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
2580:    a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
2581:    kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
2582:    is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
2583:    with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
2584:    to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

2586:ROMEO

2588:    Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
2589:    protest unto thee--

2591:Nurse

2593:    Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
2594:    Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

2596:ROMEO

2598:    What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

2600:Nurse

2602:    I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
2603:    I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

2605:ROMEO

2607:    Bid her devise
2608:    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
2609:    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
2610:    Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

2612:Nurse

2614:    No truly sir; not a penny.

2616:ROMEO

2618:    Go to; I say you shall.

2620:Nurse

2622:    This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

2624:ROMEO

2626:    And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
2627:    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
2628:    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
2629:    Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
2630:    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2631:    Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
2632:    Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

2634:Nurse

2636:    Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

2638:ROMEO

2640:    What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

2642:Nurse

2644:    Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
2645:    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

2647:ROMEO

2649:    I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

2651:NURSE

2653:    Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
2654:    Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
2655:    is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
2656:    lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
2657:    see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
2658:    sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
2659:    man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
2660:    as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
2661:    rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

2663:ROMEO

2665:    Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

2667:Nurse

2669:    Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
2670:    the--No; I know it begins with some other
2671:    letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
2672:    it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
2673:    to hear it.

2675:ROMEO

2677:    Commend me to thy lady.

2679:Nurse

2681:    Ay, a thousand times.

2683:    Exit Romeo
2684:    Peter!

2686:PETER

2688:    Anon!

2690:Nurse

2692:    Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

2694:    Exeunt

2696:SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.

2698:    Enter JULIET 

2700:JULIET

2702:    The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
2703:    In half an hour she promised to return.
2704:    Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
2705:    O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
2706:    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
2707:    Driving back shadows over louring hills:
2708:    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
2709:    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2710:    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2711:    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
2712:    Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
2713:    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2714:    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
2715:    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2716:    And his to me:
2717:    But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
2718:    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
2719:    O God, she comes!

2721:    Enter Nurse and PETER
2722:    O honey nurse, what news?
2723:    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

2725:Nurse

2727:    Peter, stay at the gate.

2729:    Exit PETER

2731:JULIET

2733:    Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
2734:    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
2735:    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
2736:    By playing it to me with so sour a face.

2738:Nurse

2740:    I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
2741:    Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

2743:JULIET

2745:    I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
2746:    Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

2748:Nurse

2750:    Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
2751:    Do you not see that I am out of breath?

2753:JULIET

2755:    How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
2756:    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2757:    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2758:    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2759:    Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
2760:    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
2761:    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

2763:Nurse

2765:    Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
2766:    how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
2767:    face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
2768:    all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
2769:    though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
2770:    past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
2771:    but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
2772:    ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?

2774:JULIET

2776:    No, no: but all this did I know before.
2777:    What says he of our marriage? what of that?

2779:Nurse

2781:    Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
2782:    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2783:    My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
2784:    Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
2785:    To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

2787:JULIET

2789:    I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2790:    Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

2792:Nurse

2794:    Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
2795:    courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
2796:    warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

2798:JULIET

2800:    Where is my mother! why, she is within;
2801:    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
2802:    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2803:    Where is your mother?'

2805:Nurse

2807:    O God's lady dear!
2808:    Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
2809:    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2810:    Henceforward do your messages yourself.

2812:JULIET

2814:    Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

2816:Nurse

2818:    Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

2820:JULIET

2822:    I have.

2824:Nurse

2826:    Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
2827:    There stays a husband to make you a wife:
2828:    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
2829:    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2830:    Hie you to church; I must another way,
2831:    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
2832:    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
2833:    I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
2834:    But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
2835:    Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

2837:JULIET

2839:    Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

2841:    Exeunt

2843:SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.

2845:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO 

2847:FRIAR LAURENCE

2849:    So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
2850:    That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

2852:ROMEO

2854:    Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
2855:    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2856:    That one short minute gives me in her sight:
2857:    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2858:    Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
2859:    It is enough I may but call her mine.

2861:FRIAR LAURENCE

2863:    These violent delights have violent ends
2864:    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
2865:    Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
2866:    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
2867:    And in the taste confounds the appetite:
2868:    Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
2869:    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

2871:    Enter JULIET
2872:    Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
2873:    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
2874:    A lover may bestride the gossamer
2875:    That idles in the wanton summer air,
2876:    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

2878:JULIET

2880:    Good even to my ghostly confessor.

2882:FRIAR LAURENCE

2884:    Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

2886:JULIET

2888:    As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

2890:ROMEO

2892:    Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2893:    Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
2894:    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2895:    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
2896:    Unfold the imagined happiness that both
2897:    Receive in either by this dear encounter.

2899:JULIET

2901:    Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2902:    Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
2903:    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2904:    But my true love is grown to such excess
2905:    I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

2907:FRIAR LAURENCE

2909:    Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2910:    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2911:    Till holy church incorporate two in one.

2913:    Exeunt

2915:ACT III
2916:SCENE I. A public place.

2918:    Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants 

2920:BENVOLIO

2922:    I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
2923:    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
2924:    And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
2925:    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

2927:MERCUTIO

2929:    Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
2930:    enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
2931:    upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
2932:    thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
2933:    it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

2935:BENVOLIO

2937:    Am I like such a fellow?

2939:MERCUTIO

2941:    Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
2942:    any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
2943:    soon moody to be moved.

2945:BENVOLIO

2947:    And what to?

2949:MERCUTIO

2951:    Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
2952:    shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
2953:    thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
2954:    or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
2955:    wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2956:    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
2957:    eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
2958:    Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
2959:    meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
2960:    an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
2961:    man for coughing in the street, because he hath
2962:    wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
2963:    didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
2964:    his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
2965:    tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
2966:    wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

2968:BENVOLIO

2970:    An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
2971:    should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

2973:MERCUTIO

2975:    The fee-simple! O simple!

2977:BENVOLIO

2979:    By my head, here come the Capulets.

2981:MERCUTIO

2983:    By my heel, I care not.

2985:    Enter TYBALT and others

2987:TYBALT

2989:    Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2990:    Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

2992:MERCUTIO

2994:    And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2995:    something; make it a word and a blow.

2997:TYBALT

2999:    You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
3000:    will give me occasion.

3002:MERCUTIO

3004:    Could you not take some occasion without giving?

3006:TYBALT

3008:    Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

3010:MERCUTIO

3012:    Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
3013:    thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
3014:    discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
3015:    make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

3017:BENVOLIO

3019:    We talk here in the public haunt of men:
3020:    Either withdraw unto some private place,
3021:    And reason coldly of your grievances,
3022:    Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

3024:MERCUTIO

3026:    Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
3027:    I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

3029:    Enter ROMEO

3031:TYBALT

3033:    Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

3035:MERCUTIO

3037:    But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
3038:    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
3039:    Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

3041:TYBALT

3043:    Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
3044:    No better term than this,--thou art a villain.

3046:ROMEO

3048:    Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
3049:    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
3050:    To such a greeting: villain am I none;
3051:    Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

3053:TYBALT

3055:    Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
3056:    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

3058:ROMEO

3060:    I do protest, I never injured thee,
3061:    But love thee better than thou canst devise,
3062:    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
3063:    And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
3064:    As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

3066:MERCUTIO

3068:    O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
3069:    Alla stoccata carries it away.

3071:    Draws
3072:    Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

3074:TYBALT

3076:    What wouldst thou have with me?

3078:MERCUTIO

3080:    Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
3081:    lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
3082:    shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
3083:    eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
3084:    by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
3085:    ears ere it be out.

3087:TYBALT

3089:    I am for you.

3091:    Drawing

3093:ROMEO

3095:    Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

3097:MERCUTIO

3099:    Come, sir, your passado.

3101:    They fight

3103:ROMEO

3105:    Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
3106:    Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
3107:    Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
3108:    Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
3109:    Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

3111:    TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers

3113:MERCUTIO

3115:    I am hurt.
3116:    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
3117:    Is he gone, and hath nothing?

3119:BENVOLIO

3121:    What, art thou hurt?

3123:MERCUTIO

3125:    Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
3126:    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

3128:    Exit Page

3130:ROMEO

3132:    Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

3134:MERCUTIO

3136:    No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
3137:    church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
3138:    me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
3139:    am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
3140:    both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
3141:    cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
3142:    rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
3143:    arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
3144:    was hurt under your arm.

3146:ROMEO

3148:    I thought all for the best.

3150:MERCUTIO

3152:    Help me into some house, Benvolio,
3153:    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
3154:    They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
3155:    And soundly too: your houses!

3157:    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

3159:ROMEO

3161:    This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
3162:    My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
3163:    In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
3164:    With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
3165:    Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
3166:    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
3167:    And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

3169:    Re-enter BENVOLIO

3171:BENVOLIO

3173:    O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
3174:    That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
3175:    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

3177:ROMEO

3179:    This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
3180:    This but begins the woe, others must end.

3182:BENVOLIO

3184:    Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

3186:ROMEO

3188:    Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
3189:    Away to heaven, respective lenity,
3190:    And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!

3192:    Re-enter TYBALT
3193:    Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
3194:    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
3195:    Is but a little way above our heads,
3196:    Staying for thine to keep him company:
3197:    Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

3199:TYBALT

3201:    Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
3202:    Shalt with him hence.

3204:ROMEO

3206:    This shall determine that.

3208:    They fight; TYBALT falls

3210:BENVOLIO

3212:    Romeo, away, be gone!
3213:    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
3214:    Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
3215:    If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

3217:ROMEO

3219:    O, I am fortune's fool!

3221:BENVOLIO

3223:    Why dost thou stay?

3225:    Exit ROMEO

3227:    Enter Citizens, & c

3229:First Citizen

3231:    Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
3232:    Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

3234:BENVOLIO

3236:    There lies that Tybalt.

3238:First Citizen

3240:    Up, sir, go with me;
3241:    I charge thee in the princes name, obey.

3243:    Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others

3245:PRINCE

3247:    Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

3249:BENVOLIO

3251:    O noble prince, I can discover all
3252:    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
3253:    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
3254:    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

3256:LADY CAPULET

3258:    Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
3259:    O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
3260:    O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
3261:    For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
3262:    O cousin, cousin!

3264:PRINCE

3266:    Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

3268:BENVOLIO

3270:    Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
3271:    Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
3272:    How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
3273:    Your high displeasure: all this uttered
3274:    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
3275:    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
3276:    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
3277:    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
3278:    Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
3279:    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
3280:    Cold death aside, and with the other sends
3281:    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
3282:    Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
3283:    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
3284:    his tongue,
3285:    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
3286:    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
3287:    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
3288:    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
3289:    But by and by comes back to Romeo,
3290:    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
3291:    And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
3292:    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
3293:    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
3294:    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

3296:LADY CAPULET

3298:    He is a kinsman to the Montague;
3299:    Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
3300:    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
3301:    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
3302:    I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
3303:    Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

3305:PRINCE

3307:    Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
3308:    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

3310:MONTAGUE

3312:    Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
3313:    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
3314:    The life of Tybalt.

3316:PRINCE

3318:    And for that offence
3319:    Immediately we do exile him hence:
3320:    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
3321:    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
3322:    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
3323:    That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
3324:    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
3325:    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
3326:    Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
3327:    Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
3328:    Bear hence this body and attend our will:
3329:    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

3331:    Exeunt

3333:SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

3335:    Enter JULIET 

3337:JULIET

3339:    Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
3340:    Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
3341:    As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
3342:    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
3343:    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
3344:    That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
3345:    Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
3346:    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
3347:    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
3348:    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
3349:    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
3350:    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
3351:    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
3352:    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
3353:    With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
3354:    Think true love acted simple modesty.
3355:    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
3356:    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
3357:    Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
3358:    Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
3359:    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
3360:    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
3361:    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
3362:    That all the world will be in love with night
3363:    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
3364:    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
3365:    But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
3366:    Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
3367:    As is the night before some festival
3368:    To an impatient child that hath new robes
3369:    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
3370:    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
3371:    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.

3373:    Enter Nurse, with cords
3374:    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
3375:    That Romeo bid thee fetch?

3377:Nurse

3379:    Ay, ay, the cords.

3381:    Throws them down

3383:JULIET

3385:    Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

3387:Nurse

3389:    Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
3390:    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
3391:    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

3393:JULIET

3395:    Can heaven be so envious?

3397:Nurse

3399:    Romeo can,
3400:    Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
3401:    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

3403:JULIET

3405:    What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
3406:    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
3407:    Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
3408:    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
3409:    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
3410:    I am not I, if there be such an I;
3411:    Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
3412:    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
3413:    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

3415:Nurse

3417:    I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
3418:    God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
3419:    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
3420:    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
3421:    All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

3423:JULIET

3425:    O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
3426:    To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
3427:    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
3428:    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

3430:Nurse

3432:    O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
3433:    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
3434:    That ever I should live to see thee dead!

3436:JULIET

3438:    What storm is this that blows so contrary?
3439:    Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
3440:    My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
3441:    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
3442:    For who is living, if those two are gone?

3444:Nurse

3446:    Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
3447:    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

3449:JULIET

3451:    O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

3453:Nurse

3455:    It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

3457:JULIET

3459:    O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
3460:    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
3461:    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
3462:    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
3463:    Despised substance of divinest show!
3464:    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
3465:    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
3466:    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
3467:    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
3468:    In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
3469:    Was ever book containing such vile matter
3470:    So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
3471:    In such a gorgeous palace!

3473:Nurse

3475:    There's no trust,
3476:    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
3477:    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
3478:    Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
3479:    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
3480:    Shame come to Romeo!

3482:JULIET

3484:    Blister'd be thy tongue
3485:    For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
3486:    Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
3487:    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
3488:    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
3489:    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

3491:Nurse

3493:    Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

3495:JULIET

3497:    Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
3498:    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
3499:    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
3500:    But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
3501:    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
3502:    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
3503:    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
3504:    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
3505:    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
3506:    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
3507:    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
3508:    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
3509:    That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
3510:    But, O, it presses to my memory,
3511:    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
3512:    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
3513:    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
3514:    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
3515:    Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
3516:    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
3517:    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
3518:    Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
3519:    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
3520:    Which modern lamentations might have moved?
3521:    But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
3522:    'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
3523:    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
3524:    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
3525:    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
3526:    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
3527:    Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

3529:Nurse

3531:    Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
3532:    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

3534:JULIET

3536:    Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
3537:    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
3538:    Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
3539:    Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
3540:    He made you for a highway to my bed;
3541:    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
3542:    Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
3543:    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

3545:Nurse

3547:    Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
3548:    To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
3549:    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
3550:    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

3552:JULIET

3554:    O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
3555:    And bid him come to take his last farewell.

3557:    Exeunt

3559:SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.

3561:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE 

3563:FRIAR LAURENCE

3565:    Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
3566:    Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
3567:    And thou art wedded to calamity.

3569:    Enter ROMEO

3571:ROMEO

3573:    Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
3574:    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
3575:    That I yet know not?

3577:FRIAR LAURENCE

3579:    Too familiar
3580:    Is my dear son with such sour company:
3581:    I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

3583:ROMEO

3585:    What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

3587:FRIAR LAURENCE

3589:    A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
3590:    Not body's death, but body's banishment.

3592:ROMEO

3594:    Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
3595:    For exile hath more terror in his look,
3596:    Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

3598:FRIAR LAURENCE

3600:    Hence from Verona art thou banished:
3601:    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

3603:ROMEO

3605:    There is no world without Verona walls,
3606:    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
3607:    Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
3608:    And world's exile is death: then banished,
3609:    Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
3610:    Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
3611:    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

3613:FRIAR LAURENCE

3615:    O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
3616:    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
3617:    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
3618:    And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
3619:    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

3621:ROMEO

3623:    'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
3624:    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
3625:    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
3626:    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
3627:    But Romeo may not: more validity,
3628:    More honourable state, more courtship lives
3629:    In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
3630:    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
3631:    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
3632:    Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
3633:    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
3634:    But Romeo may not; he is banished:
3635:    Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
3636:    They are free men, but I am banished.
3637:    And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
3638:    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
3639:    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
3640:    But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
3641:    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
3642:    Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
3643:    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
3644:    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
3645:    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

3647:FRIAR LAURENCE

3649:    Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.

3651:ROMEO

3653:    O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

3655:FRIAR LAURENCE

3657:    I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
3658:    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
3659:    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

3661:ROMEO

3663:    Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
3664:    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
3665:    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
3666:    It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

3668:FRIAR LAURENCE

3670:    O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

3672:ROMEO

3674:    How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

3676:FRIAR LAURENCE

3678:    Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

3680:ROMEO

3682:    Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
3683:    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
3684:    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
3685:    Doting like me and like me banished,
3686:    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
3687:    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
3688:    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

3690:    Knocking within

3692:FRIAR LAURENCE

3694:    Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.

3696:ROMEO

3698:    Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
3699:    Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

3701:    Knocking

3703:FRIAR LAURENCE

3705:    Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
3706:    Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;

3708:    Knocking
3709:    Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
3710:    What simpleness is this! I come, I come!

3712:    Knocking
3713:    Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

3715:Nurse

3717:    [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
3718:    my errand;
3719:    I come from Lady Juliet.

3721:FRIAR LAURENCE

3723:    Welcome, then.

3725:    Enter Nurse

3727:Nurse

3729:    O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
3730:    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

3732:FRIAR LAURENCE

3734:    There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

3736:Nurse

3738:    O, he is even in my mistress' case,
3739:    Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
3740:    Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
3741:    Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
3742:    Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
3743:    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
3744:    Why should you fall into so deep an O?

3746:ROMEO

3748:    Nurse!

3750:Nurse

3752:    Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

3754:ROMEO

3756:    Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
3757:    Doth she not think me an old murderer,
3758:    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
3759:    With blood removed but little from her own?
3760:    Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
3761:    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

3763:Nurse

3765:    O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
3766:    And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
3767:    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
3768:    And then down falls again.

3770:ROMEO

3772:    As if that name,
3773:    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
3774:    Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
3775:    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
3776:    In what vile part of this anatomy
3777:    Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
3778:    The hateful mansion.

3780:    Drawing his sword

3782:FRIAR LAURENCE

3784:    Hold thy desperate hand:
3785:    Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
3786:    Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
3787:    The unreasonable fury of a beast:
3788:    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
3789:    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
3790:    Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
3791:    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
3792:    Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
3793:    And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
3794:    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
3795:    Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
3796:    Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
3797:    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
3798:    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
3799:    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
3800:    And usest none in that true use indeed
3801:    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
3802:    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
3803:    Digressing from the valour of a man;
3804:    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
3805:    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
3806:    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
3807:    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
3808:    Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
3809:    Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
3810:    And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
3811:    What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
3812:    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
3813:    There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
3814:    But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
3815:    The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
3816:    And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
3817:    A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
3818:    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
3819:    But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
3820:    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
3821:    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
3822:    Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
3823:    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
3824:    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
3825:    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
3826:    Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
3827:    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
3828:    Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
3829:    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
3830:    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
3831:    Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
3832:    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
3833:    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
3834:    Romeo is coming.

3836:Nurse

3838:    O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
3839:    To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
3840:    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

3842:ROMEO

3844:    Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

3846:Nurse

3848:    Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
3849:    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

3851:    Exit

3853:ROMEO

3855:    How well my comfort is revived by this!

3857:FRIAR LAURENCE

3859:    Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
3860:    Either be gone before the watch be set,
3861:    Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
3862:    Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
3863:    And he shall signify from time to time
3864:    Every good hap to you that chances here:
3865:    Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

3867:ROMEO

3869:    But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
3870:    It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

3872:    Exeunt

3874:SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.

3876:    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS 

3878:CAPULET

3880:    Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
3881:    That we have had no time to move our daughter:
3882:    Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
3883:    And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
3884:    'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
3885:    I promise you, but for your company,
3886:    I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

3888:PARIS

3890:    These times of woe afford no time to woo.
3891:    Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

3893:LADY CAPULET

3895:    I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
3896:    To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

3898:CAPULET

3900:    Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
3901:    Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
3902:    In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
3903:    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
3904:    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
3905:    And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
3906:    But, soft! what day is this?

3908:PARIS

3910:    Monday, my lord,

3912:CAPULET

3914:    Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
3915:    O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
3916:    She shall be married to this noble earl.
3917:    Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
3918:    We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
3919:    For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
3920:    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
3921:    Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
3922:    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
3923:    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

3925:PARIS

3927:    My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

3929:CAPULET

3931:    Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
3932:    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
3933:    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
3934:    Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
3935:    Afore me! it is so very very late,
3936:    That we may call it early by and by.
3937:    Good night.

3939:    Exeunt

3941:SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.

3943:    Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window 

3945:JULIET

3947:    Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
3948:    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
3949:    That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
3950:    Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
3951:    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

3953:ROMEO

3955:    It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
3956:    No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
3957:    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
3958:    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
3959:    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
3960:    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

3962:JULIET

3964:    Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
3965:    It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
3966:    To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
3967:    And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
3968:    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

3970:ROMEO

3972:    Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
3973:    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
3974:    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
3975:    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
3976:    Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
3977:    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
3978:    I have more care to stay than will to go:
3979:    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
3980:    How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

3982:JULIET

3984:    It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
3985:    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
3986:    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
3987:    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
3988:    This doth not so, for she divideth us:
3989:    Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
3990:    O, now I would they had changed voices too!
3991:    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
3992:    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
3993:    O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

3995:ROMEO

3997:    More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

3999:    Enter Nurse, to the chamber

4001:Nurse

4003:    Madam!

4005:JULIET

4007:    Nurse?

4009:Nurse

4011:    Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
4012:    The day is broke; be wary, look about.

4014:    Exit

4016:JULIET

4018:    Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

4020:ROMEO

4022:    Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

4024:    He goeth down

4026:JULIET

4028:    Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
4029:    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
4030:    For in a minute there are many days:
4031:    O, by this count I shall be much in years
4032:    Ere I again behold my Romeo!

4034:ROMEO

4036:    Farewell!
4037:    I will omit no opportunity
4038:    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

4040:JULIET

4042:    O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

4044:ROMEO

4046:    I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
4047:    For sweet discourses in our time to come.

4049:JULIET

4051:    O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
4052:    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
4053:    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
4054:    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

4056:ROMEO

4058:    And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
4059:    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

4061:    Exit

4063:JULIET

4065:    O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
4066:    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
4067:    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
4068:    For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
4069:    But send him back.

4071:LADY CAPULET

4073:    [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?

4075:JULIET

4077:    Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
4078:    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
4079:    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

4081:    Enter LADY CAPULET

4083:LADY CAPULET

4085:    Why, how now, Juliet!

4087:JULIET

4089:    Madam, I am not well.

4091:LADY CAPULET

4093:    Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
4094:    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
4095:    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
4096:    Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
4097:    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

4099:JULIET

4101:    Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

4103:LADY CAPULET

4105:    So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
4106:    Which you weep for.

4108:JULIET

4110:    Feeling so the loss,
4111:    Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

4113:LADY CAPULET

4115:    Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
4116:    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

4118:JULIET

4120:    What villain madam?

4122:LADY CAPULET

4124:    That same villain, Romeo.

4126:JULIET

4128:    [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
4129:    God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
4130:    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

4132:LADY CAPULET

4134:    That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

4136:JULIET

4138:    Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
4139:    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

4141:LADY CAPULET

4143:    We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
4144:    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
4145:    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
4146:    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
4147:    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
4148:    And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

4150:JULIET

4152:    Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
4153:    With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
4154:    Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
4155:    Madam, if you could find out but a man
4156:    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
4157:    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
4158:    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
4159:    To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
4160:    To wreak the love I bore my cousin
4161:    Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

4163:LADY CAPULET

4165:    Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
4166:    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

4168:JULIET

4170:    And joy comes well in such a needy time:
4171:    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

4173:LADY CAPULET

4175:    Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
4176:    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
4177:    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
4178:    That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

4180:JULIET

4182:    Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

4184:LADY CAPULET

4186:    Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
4187:    The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
4188:    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
4189:    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

4191:JULIET

4193:    Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
4194:    He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
4195:    I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
4196:    Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
4197:    I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
4198:    I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
4199:    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
4200:    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

4202:LADY CAPULET

4204:    Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
4205:    And see how he will take it at your hands.

4207:    Enter CAPULET and Nurse

4209:CAPULET

4211:    When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
4212:    But for the sunset of my brother's son
4213:    It rains downright.
4214:    How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
4215:    Evermore showering? In one little body
4216:    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
4217:    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
4218:    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
4219:    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
4220:    Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
4221:    Without a sudden calm, will overset
4222:    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
4223:    Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

4225:LADY CAPULET

4227:    Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
4228:    I would the fool were married to her grave!

4230:CAPULET

4232:    Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
4233:    How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
4234:    Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
4235:    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
4236:    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

4238:JULIET

4240:    Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
4241:    Proud can I never be of what I hate;
4242:    But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

4244:CAPULET

4246:    How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
4247:    'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
4248:    And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
4249:    Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
4250:    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
4251:    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
4252:    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
4253:    Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
4254:    You tallow-face!

4256:LADY CAPULET

4258:    Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

4260:JULIET

4262:    Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
4263:    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

4265:CAPULET

4267:    Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
4268:    I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
4269:    Or never after look me in the face:
4270:    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
4271:    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
4272:    That God had lent us but this only child;
4273:    But now I see this one is one too much,
4274:    And that we have a curse in having her:
4275:    Out on her, hilding!

4277:Nurse

4279:    God in heaven bless her!
4280:    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

4282:CAPULET

4284:    And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
4285:    Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

4287:Nurse

4289:    I speak no treason.

4291:CAPULET

4293:    O, God ye god-den.

4295:Nurse

4297:    May not one speak?

4299:CAPULET

4301:    Peace, you mumbling fool!
4302:    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
4303:    For here we need it not.

4305:LADY CAPULET

4307:    You are too hot.

4309:CAPULET

4311:    God's bread! it makes me mad:
4312:    Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
4313:    Alone, in company, still my care hath been
4314:    To have her match'd: and having now provided
4315:    A gentleman of noble parentage,
4316:    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
4317:    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
4318:    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
4319:    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
4320:    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
4321:    To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
4322:    I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
4323:    But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
4324:    Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
4325:    Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
4326:    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
4327:    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
4328:    And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
4329:    the streets,
4330:    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
4331:    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
4332:    Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

4334:    Exit

4336:JULIET

4338:    Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
4339:    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
4340:    O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
4341:    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
4342:    Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
4343:    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

4345:LADY CAPULET

4347:    Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
4348:    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

4350:    Exit

4352:JULIET

4354:    O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
4355:    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
4356:    How shall that faith return again to earth,
4357:    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
4358:    By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
4359:    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
4360:    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
4361:    What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
4362:    Some comfort, nurse.

4364:Nurse

4366:    Faith, here it is.
4367:    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
4368:    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
4369:    Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
4370:    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
4371:    I think it best you married with the county.
4372:    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
4373:    Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
4374:    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
4375:    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
4376:    I think you are happy in this second match,
4377:    For it excels your first: or if it did not,
4378:    Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
4379:    As living here and you no use of him.

4381:JULIET

4383:    Speakest thou from thy heart?

4385:Nurse

4387:    And from my soul too;
4388:    Or else beshrew them both.

4390:JULIET

4392:    Amen!

4394:Nurse

4396:    What?

4398:JULIET

4400:    Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
4401:    Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
4402:    Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
4403:    To make confession and to be absolved.

4405:Nurse

4407:    Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

4409:    Exit

4411:JULIET

4413:    Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
4414:    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
4415:    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
4416:    Which she hath praised him with above compare
4417:    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
4418:    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
4419:    I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
4420:    If all else fail, myself have power to die.

4422:    Exit

4424:ACT IV
4425:SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.

4427:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS 

4429:FRIAR LAURENCE

4431:    On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

4433:PARIS

4435:    My father Capulet will have it so;
4436:    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

4438:FRIAR LAURENCE

4440:    You say you do not know the lady's mind:
4441:    Uneven is the course, I like it not.

4443:PARIS

4445:    Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
4446:    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
4447:    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
4448:    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
4449:    That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
4450:    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
4451:    To stop the inundation of her tears;
4452:    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
4453:    May be put from her by society:
4454:    Now do you know the reason of this haste.

4456:FRIAR LAURENCE

4458:    [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
4459:    Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.

4461:    Enter JULIET

4463:PARIS

4465:    Happily met, my lady and my wife!

4467:JULIET

4469:    That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

4471:PARIS

4473:    That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

4475:JULIET

4477:    What must be shall be.

4479:FRIAR LAURENCE

4481:    That's a certain text.

4483:PARIS

4485:    Come you to make confession to this father?

4487:JULIET

4489:    To answer that, I should confess to you.

4491:PARIS

4493:    Do not deny to him that you love me.

4495:JULIET

4497:    I will confess to you that I love him.

4499:PARIS

4501:    So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

4503:JULIET

4505:    If I do so, it will be of more price,
4506:    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

4508:PARIS

4510:    Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

4512:JULIET

4514:    The tears have got small victory by that;
4515:    For it was bad enough before their spite.

4517:PARIS

4519:    Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

4521:JULIET

4523:    That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
4524:    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

4526:PARIS

4528:    Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

4530:JULIET

4532:    It may be so, for it is not mine own.
4533:    Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
4534:    Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

4536:FRIAR LAURENCE

4538:    My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
4539:    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

4541:PARIS

4543:    God shield I should disturb devotion!
4544:    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
4545:    Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

4547:    Exit

4549:JULIET

4551:    O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
4552:    Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

4554:FRIAR LAURENCE

4556:    Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
4557:    It strains me past the compass of my wits:
4558:    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
4559:    On Thursday next be married to this county.

4561:JULIET

4563:    Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
4564:    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
4565:    If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
4566:    Do thou but call my resolution wise,
4567:    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
4568:    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
4569:    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
4570:    Shall be the label to another deed,
4571:    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
4572:    Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
4573:    Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
4574:    Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
4575:    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
4576:    Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
4577:    Which the commission of thy years and art
4578:    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
4579:    Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
4580:    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

4582:FRIAR LAURENCE

4584:    Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
4585:    Which craves as desperate an execution.
4586:    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
4587:    If, rather than to marry County Paris,
4588:    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
4589:    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
4590:    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
4591:    That copest with death himself to scape from it:
4592:    And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

4594:JULIET

4596:    O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
4597:    From off the battlements of yonder tower;
4598:    Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
4599:    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
4600:    Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
4601:    O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
4602:    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
4603:    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
4604:    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
4605:    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
4606:    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
4607:    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

4609:FRIAR LAURENCE

4611:    Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
4612:    To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
4613:    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
4614:    Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
4615:    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
4616:    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
4617:    When presently through all thy veins shall run
4618:    A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
4619:    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
4620:    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
4621:    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
4622:    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
4623:    Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
4624:    Each part, deprived of supple government,
4625:    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
4626:    And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
4627:    Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
4628:    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
4629:    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
4630:    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
4631:    Then, as the manner of our country is,
4632:    In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
4633:    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
4634:    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
4635:    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
4636:    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
4637:    And hither shall he come: and he and I
4638:    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
4639:    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
4640:    And this shall free thee from this present shame;
4641:    If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
4642:    Abate thy valour in the acting it.

4644:JULIET

4646:    Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

4648:FRIAR LAURENCE

4650:    Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
4651:    In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
4652:    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

4654:JULIET

4656:    Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
4657:    Farewell, dear father!

4659:    Exeunt

4661:SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.

4663:    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen 

4665:CAPULET

4667:    So many guests invite as here are writ.

4669:    Exit First Servant
4670:    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

4672:Second Servant

4674:    You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
4675:    can lick their fingers.

4677:CAPULET

4679:    How canst thou try them so?

4681:Second Servant

4683:    Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
4684:    own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
4685:    fingers goes not with me.

4687:CAPULET

4689:    Go, be gone.

4691:    Exit Second Servant
4692:    We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
4693:    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

4695:Nurse

4697:    Ay, forsooth.

4699:CAPULET

4701:    Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
4702:    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

4704:Nurse

4706:    See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

4708:    Enter JULIET

4710:CAPULET

4712:    How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

4714:JULIET

4716:    Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
4717:    Of disobedient opposition
4718:    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
4719:    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
4720:    And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
4721:    Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

4723:CAPULET

4725:    Send for the county; go tell him of this:
4726:    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

4728:JULIET

4730:    I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
4731:    And gave him what becomed love I might,
4732:    Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

4734:CAPULET

4736:    Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
4737:    This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
4738:    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
4739:    Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
4740:    Our whole city is much bound to him.

4742:JULIET

4744:    Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
4745:    To help me sort such needful ornaments
4746:    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

4748:LADY CAPULET

4750:    No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

4752:CAPULET

4754:    Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

4756:    Exeunt JULIET and Nurse

4758:LADY CAPULET

4760:    We shall be short in our provision:
4761:    'Tis now near night.

4763:CAPULET

4765:    Tush, I will stir about,
4766:    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
4767:    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
4768:    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
4769:    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
4770:    They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
4771:    To County Paris, to prepare him up
4772:    Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
4773:    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

4775:    Exeunt

4777:SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.

4779:    Enter JULIET and Nurse 

4781:JULIET

4783:    Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
4784:    I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
4785:    For I have need of many orisons
4786:    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
4787:    Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

4789:    Enter LADY CAPULET

4791:LADY CAPULET

4793:    What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

4795:JULIET

4797:    No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
4798:    As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
4799:    So please you, let me now be left alone,
4800:    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
4801:    For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
4802:    In this so sudden business.

4804:LADY CAPULET

4806:    Good night:
4807:    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

4809:    Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

4811:JULIET

4813:    Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
4814:    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
4815:    That almost freezes up the heat of life:
4816:    I'll call them back again to comfort me:
4817:    Nurse! What should she do here?
4818:    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
4819:    Come, vial.
4820:    What if this mixture do not work at all?
4821:    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
4822:    No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.

4824:    Laying down her dagger
4825:    What if it be a poison, which the friar
4826:    Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
4827:    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
4828:    Because he married me before to Romeo?
4829:    I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
4830:    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
4831:    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
4832:    I wake before the time that Romeo
4833:    Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
4834:    Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
4835:    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
4836:    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
4837:    Or, if I live, is it not very like,
4838:    The horrible conceit of death and night,
4839:    Together with the terror of the place,--
4840:    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
4841:    Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
4842:    Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
4843:    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
4844:    Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
4845:    At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
4846:    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
4847:    So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
4848:    And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
4849:    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
4850:    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
4851:    Environed with all these hideous fears?
4852:    And madly play with my forefather's joints?
4853:    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
4854:    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
4855:    As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
4856:    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
4857:    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
4858:    Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
4859:    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

4861:    She falls upon her bed, within the curtains

4863:SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.

4865:    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse 

4867:LADY CAPULET

4869:    Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

4871:Nurse

4873:    They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

4875:    Enter CAPULET

4877:CAPULET

4879:    Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
4880:    The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
4881:    Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
4882:    Spare not for the cost.

4884:Nurse

4886:    Go, you cot-quean, go,
4887:    Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
4888:    For this night's watching.

4890:CAPULET

4892:    No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
4893:    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

4895:LADY CAPULET

4897:    Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
4898:    But I will watch you from such watching now.

4900:    Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

4902:CAPULET

4904:    A jealous hood, a jealous hood!

4906:    Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
4907:    Now, fellow,
4908:    What's there?

4910:First Servant

4912:    Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

4914:CAPULET

4916:    Make haste, make haste.

4918:    Exit First Servant
4919:    Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
4920:    Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

4922:Second Servant

4924:    I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
4925:    And never trouble Peter for the matter.

4927:    Exit

4929:CAPULET

4931:    Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
4932:    Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
4933:    The county will be here with music straight,
4934:    For so he said he would: I hear him near.

4936:    Music within
4937:    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!

4939:    Re-enter Nurse
4940:    Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
4941:    I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
4942:    Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
4943:    Make haste, I say.

4945:    Exeunt

4947:SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.

4951:Nurse

4953:    Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
4954:    Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
4955:    Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
4956:    What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
4957:    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
4958:    The County Paris hath set up his rest,
4959:    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
4960:    Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
4961:    I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
4962:    Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
4963:    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?

4965:    Undraws the curtains
4966:    What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
4967:    I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
4968:    Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
4969:    O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
4970:    Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

4974:LADY CAPULET

4976:    What noise is here?

4978:Nurse

4980:    O lamentable day!

4982:LADY CAPULET

4984:    What is the matter?

4986:Nurse

4988:    Look, look! O heavy day!

4990:LADY CAPULET

4992:    O me, O me! My child, my only life,
4993:    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
4994:    Help, help! Call help.

4996:    Enter CAPULET

4998:CAPULET

5000:    For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

5002:Nurse

5004:    She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

5006:LADY CAPULET

5008:    Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

5010:CAPULET

5012:    Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
5013:    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
5014:    Life and these lips have long been separated:
5015:    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
5016:    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

5018:Nurse

5020:    O lamentable day!

5022:LADY CAPULET

5024:    O woful time!

5026:CAPULET

5028:    Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
5029:    Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

5031:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians

5033:FRIAR LAURENCE

5035:    Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

5037:CAPULET

5039:    Ready to go, but never to return.
5040:    O son! the night before thy wedding-day
5041:    Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
5042:    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
5043:    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
5044:    My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
5045:    And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

5047:PARIS

5049:    Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
5050:    And doth it give me such a sight as this?

5052:LADY CAPULET

5054:    Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
5055:    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
5056:    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
5057:    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
5058:    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
5059:    And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

5061:Nurse

5063:    O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
5064:    Most lamentable day, most woful day,
5065:    That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
5066:    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
5067:    Never was seen so black a day as this:
5068:    O woful day, O woful day!

5070:PARIS

5072:    Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
5073:    Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
5074:    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
5075:    O love! O life! not life, but love in death!

5077:CAPULET

5079:    Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
5080:    Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
5081:    To murder, murder our solemnity?
5082:    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
5083:    Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
5084:    And with my child my joys are buried.

5086:FRIAR LAURENCE

5088:    Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
5089:    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
5090:    Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
5091:    And all the better is it for the maid:
5092:    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
5093:    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
5094:    The most you sought was her promotion;
5095:    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
5096:    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
5097:    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
5098:    O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
5099:    That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
5100:    She's not well married that lives married long;
5101:    But she's best married that dies married young.
5102:    Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
5103:    On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
5104:    In all her best array bear her to church:
5105:    For though fond nature bids us an lament,
5106:    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

5108:CAPULET

5110:    All things that we ordained festival,
5111:    Turn from their office to black funeral;
5112:    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
5113:    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
5114:    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
5115:    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
5116:    And all things change them to the contrary.

5118:FRIAR LAURENCE

5120:    Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
5121:    And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
5122:    To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
5123:    The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
5124:    Move them no more by crossing their high will.

5126:    Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE

5128:First Musician

5130:    Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

5132:Nurse

5134:    Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
5135:    For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

5137:    Exit

5139:First Musician

5141:    Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

5143:    Enter PETER

5145:PETER

5147:    Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
5148:    ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

5150:First Musician

5152:    Why 'Heart's ease?'

5154:PETER

5156:    O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
5157:    heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
5158:    to comfort me.

5160:First Musician

5162:    Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

5164:PETER

5166:    You will not, then?

5168:First Musician

5170:    No.

5172:PETER

5174:    I will then give it you soundly.

5176:First Musician

5178:    What will you give us?

5180:PETER

5182:    No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
5183:    I will give you the minstrel.

5185:First Musician

5187:    Then I will give you the serving-creature.

5189:PETER

5191:    Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
5192:    your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
5193:    I'll fa you; do you note me?

5195:First Musician

5197:    An you re us and fa us, you note us.

5199:Second Musician

5201:    Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

5203:PETER

5205:    Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
5206:    with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
5207:    me like men:
5208:    'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
5209:    And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
5210:    Then music with her silver sound'--
5211:    why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
5212:    sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?

5214:Musician

5216:    Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

5218:PETER

5220:    Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

5222:Second Musician

5224:    I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

5226:PETER

5228:    Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?

5230:Third Musician

5232:    Faith, I know not what to say.

5234:PETER

5236:    O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
5237:    for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
5238:    because musicians have no gold for sounding:
5239:    'Then music with her silver sound
5240:    With speedy help doth lend redress.'

5242:    Exit

5244:First Musician

5246:    What a pestilent knave is this same!

5248:Second Musician

5250:    Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
5251:    mourners, and stay dinner.

5253:    Exeunt

5255:ACT V
5256:SCENE I. Mantua. A street.

5258:    Enter ROMEO 

5260:ROMEO

5262:    If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
5263:    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
5264:    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
5265:    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
5266:    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
5267:    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
5268:    Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
5269:    to think!--
5270:    And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
5271:    That I revived, and was an emperor.
5272:    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
5273:    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

5275:    Enter BALTHASAR, booted
5276:    News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
5277:    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
5278:    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
5279:    How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
5280:    For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

5282:BALTHASAR

5284:    Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
5285:    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
5286:    And her immortal part with angels lives.
5287:    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
5288:    And presently took post to tell it you:
5289:    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
5290:    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

5292:ROMEO

5294:    Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
5295:    Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
5296:    And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

5298:BALTHASAR

5300:    I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
5301:    Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
5302:    Some misadventure.

5304:ROMEO

5306:    Tush, thou art deceived:
5307:    Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
5308:    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

5310:BALTHASAR

5312:    No, my good lord.

5314:ROMEO

5316:    No matter: get thee gone,
5317:    And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.

5319:    Exit BALTHASAR
5320:    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
5321:    Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
5322:    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
5323:    I do remember an apothecary,--
5324:    And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
5325:    In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
5326:    Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
5327:    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
5328:    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
5329:    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
5330:    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
5331:    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
5332:    Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
5333:    Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
5334:    Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
5335:    Noting this penury, to myself I said
5336:    'An if a man did need a poison now,
5337:    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
5338:    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
5339:    O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
5340:    And this same needy man must sell it me.
5341:    As I remember, this should be the house.
5342:    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
5343:    What, ho! apothecary!

5345:    Enter Apothecary

5347:Apothecary

5349:    Who calls so loud?

5351:ROMEO

5353:    Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
5354:    Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
5355:    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
5356:    As will disperse itself through all the veins
5357:    That the life-weary taker may fall dead
5358:    And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
5359:    As violently as hasty powder fired
5360:    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

5362:Apothecary

5364:    Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
5365:    Is death to any he that utters them.

5367:ROMEO

5369:    Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
5370:    And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
5371:    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
5372:    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
5373:    The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
5374:    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
5375:    Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

5377:Apothecary

5379:    My poverty, but not my will, consents.

5381:ROMEO

5383:    I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

5385:Apothecary

5387:    Put this in any liquid thing you will,
5388:    And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
5389:    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

5391:ROMEO

5393:    There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
5394:    Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
5395:    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
5396:    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
5397:    Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
5398:    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
5399:    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

5401:    Exeunt

5403:SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.

5405:    Enter FRIAR JOHN 

5407:FRIAR JOHN

5409:    Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

5411:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

5413:FRIAR LAURENCE

5415:    This same should be the voice of Friar John.
5416:    Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
5417:    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

5419:FRIAR JOHN

5421:    Going to find a bare-foot brother out
5422:    One of our order, to associate me,
5423:    Here in this city visiting the sick,
5424:    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
5425:    Suspecting that we both were in a house
5426:    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
5427:    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
5428:    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

5430:FRIAR LAURENCE

5432:    Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

5434:FRIAR JOHN

5436:    I could not send it,--here it is again,--
5437:    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
5438:    So fearful were they of infection.

5440:FRIAR LAURENCE

5442:    Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
5443:    The letter was not nice but full of charge
5444:    Of dear import, and the neglecting it
5445:    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
5446:    Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
5447:    Unto my cell.

5449:FRIAR JOHN

5451:    Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.

5453:    Exit

5455:FRIAR LAURENCE

5457:    Now must I to the monument alone;
5458:    Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
5459:    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
5460:    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
5461:    But I will write again to Mantua,
5462:    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
5463:    Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

5465:    Exit

5467:SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.

5469:    Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch 

5471:PARIS

5473:    Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
5474:    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
5475:    Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
5476:    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
5477:    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
5478:    Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
5479:    But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
5480:    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
5481:    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

5483:PAGE

5485:    [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
5486:    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.

5488:    Retires

5490:PARIS

5492:    Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
5493:    O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
5494:    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
5495:    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
5496:    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
5497:    Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

5499:    The Page whistles
5500:    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
5501:    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
5502:    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
5503:    What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

5505:    Retires

5507:    Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c

5509:ROMEO

5511:    Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
5512:    Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
5513:    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
5514:    Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
5515:    Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
5516:    And do not interrupt me in my course.
5517:    Why I descend into this bed of death,
5518:    Is partly to behold my lady's face;
5519:    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
5520:    A precious ring, a ring that I must use
5521:    In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
5522:    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
5523:    In what I further shall intend to do,
5524:    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
5525:    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
5526:    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
5527:    More fierce and more inexorable far
5528:    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

5530:BALTHASAR

5532:    I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

5534:ROMEO

5536:    So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
5537:    Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

5539:BALTHASAR

5541:    [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
5542:    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.

5544:    Retires

5546:ROMEO

5548:    Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
5549:    Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
5550:    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
5551:    And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

5553:    Opens the tomb

5555:PARIS

5557:    This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
5558:    That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
5559:    It is supposed, the fair creature died;
5560:    And here is come to do some villanous shame
5561:    To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.

5563:    Comes forward
5564:    Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
5565:    Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
5566:    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
5567:    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

5569:ROMEO

5571:    I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
5572:    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
5573:    Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
5574:    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
5575:    Put not another sin upon my head,
5576:    By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
5577:    By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
5578:    For I come hither arm'd against myself:
5579:    Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
5580:    A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

5582:PARIS

5584:    I do defy thy conjurations,
5585:    And apprehend thee for a felon here.

5587:ROMEO

5589:    Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

5591:    They fight

5593:PAGE

5595:    O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

5597:    Exit

5599:PARIS

5601:    O, I am slain!

5603:    Falls
5604:    If thou be merciful,
5605:    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

5607:    Dies

5609:ROMEO

5611:    In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
5612:    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
5613:    What said my man, when my betossed soul
5614:    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
5615:    He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
5616:    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
5617:    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
5618:    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
5619:    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
5620:    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
5621:    A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
5622:    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
5623:    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
5624:    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.

5626:    Laying PARIS in the tomb
5627:    How oft when men are at the point of death
5628:    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
5629:    A lightning before death: O, how may I
5630:    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
5631:    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
5632:    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
5633:    Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
5634:    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
5635:    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
5636:    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
5637:    O, what more favour can I do to thee,
5638:    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
5639:    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
5640:    Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
5641:    Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
5642:    That unsubstantial death is amorous,
5643:    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
5644:    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
5645:    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
5646:    And never from this palace of dim night
5647:    Depart again: here, here will I remain
5648:    With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
5649:    Will I set up my everlasting rest,
5650:    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
5651:    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
5652:    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
5653:    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
5654:    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
5655:    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
5656:    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
5657:    The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
5658:    Here's to my love!

5660:    Drinks
5661:    O true apothecary!
5662:    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

5664:    Dies

5666:    Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade

5668:FRIAR LAURENCE

5670:    Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
5671:    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

5673:BALTHASAR

5675:    Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

5677:FRIAR LAURENCE

5679:    Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
5680:    What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
5681:    To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
5682:    It burneth in the Capel's monument.

5684:BALTHASAR

5686:    It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
5687:    One that you love.

5689:FRIAR LAURENCE

5691:    Who is it?

5693:BALTHASAR

5695:    Romeo.

5697:FRIAR LAURENCE

5699:    How long hath he been there?

5701:BALTHASAR

5703:    Full half an hour.

5705:FRIAR LAURENCE

5707:    Go with me to the vault.

5709:BALTHASAR

5711:    I dare not, sir
5712:    My master knows not but I am gone hence;
5713:    And fearfully did menace me with death,
5714:    If I did stay to look on his intents.

5716:FRIAR LAURENCE

5718:    Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
5719:    O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

5721:BALTHASAR

5723:    As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
5724:    I dreamt my master and another fought,
5725:    And that my master slew him.

5727:FRIAR LAURENCE

5729:    Romeo!

5731:    Advances
5732:    Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
5733:    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
5734:    What mean these masterless and gory swords
5735:    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?

5737:    Enters the tomb
5738:    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
5739:    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
5740:    Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
5741:    The lady stirs.

5743:    JULIET wakes

5745:JULIET

5747:    O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
5748:    I do remember well where I should be,
5749:    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

5751:    Noise within

5753:FRIAR LAURENCE

5755:    I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
5756:    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
5757:    A greater power than we can contradict
5758:    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
5759:    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
5760:    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
5761:    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
5762:    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
5763:    Come, go, good Juliet,

5765:    Noise again
5766:    I dare no longer stay.

5768:JULIET

5770:    Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

5772:    Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
5773:    What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
5774:    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
5775:    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
5776:    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
5777:    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
5778:    To make die with a restorative.

5780:    Kisses him
5781:    Thy lips are warm.

5783:First Watchman

5785:    [Within] Lead, boy: which way?

5787:JULIET

5789:    Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!

5791:    Snatching ROMEO's dagger
5792:    This is thy sheath;

5794:    Stabs herself
5795:    there rust, and let me die.

5797:    Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies

5799:    Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS

5801:PAGE

5803:    This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

5805:First Watchman

5807:    The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
5808:    Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
5809:    Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
5810:    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
5811:    Who here hath lain these two days buried.
5812:    Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
5813:    Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
5814:    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
5815:    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
5816:    We cannot without circumstance descry.

5818:    Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR

5820:Second Watchman

5822:    Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

5824:First Watchman

5826:    Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

5828:    Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE

5830:Third Watchman

5832:    Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
5833:    We took this mattock and this spade from him,
5834:    As he was coming from this churchyard side.

5836:First Watchman

5838:    A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

5840:    Enter the PRINCE and Attendants

5842:PRINCE

5844:    What misadventure is so early up,
5845:    That calls our person from our morning's rest?

5847:    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others

5849:CAPULET

5851:    What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

5853:LADY CAPULET

5855:    The people in the street cry Romeo,
5856:    Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
5857:    With open outcry toward our monument.

5859:PRINCE

5861:    What fear is this which startles in our ears?

5863:First Watchman

5865:    Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
5866:    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
5867:    Warm and new kill'd.

5869:PRINCE

5871:    Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

5873:First Watchman

5875:    Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
5876:    With instruments upon them, fit to open
5877:    These dead men's tombs.

5879:CAPULET

5881:    O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
5882:    This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
5883:    Is empty on the back of Montague,--
5884:    And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

5886:LADY CAPULET

5888:    O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
5889:    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

5891:    Enter MONTAGUE and others

5893:PRINCE

5895:    Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
5896:    To see thy son and heir more early down.

5898:MONTAGUE

5900:    Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
5901:    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
5902:    What further woe conspires against mine age?

5904:PRINCE

5906:    Look, and thou shalt see.

5908:MONTAGUE

5910:    O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
5911:    To press before thy father to a grave?

5913:PRINCE

5915:    Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
5916:    Till we can clear these ambiguities,
5917:    And know their spring, their head, their
5918:    true descent;
5919:    And then will I be general of your woes,
5920:    And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
5921:    And let mischance be slave to patience.
5922:    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

5924:FRIAR LAURENCE

5926:    I am the greatest, able to do least,
5927:    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
5928:    Doth make against me of this direful murder;
5929:    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
5930:    Myself condemned and myself excused.

5932:PRINCE

5934:    Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

5936:FRIAR LAURENCE

5938:    I will be brief, for my short date of breath
5939:    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
5940:    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
5941:    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
5942:    I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
5943:    Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
5944:    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
5945:    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
5946:    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
5947:    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
5948:    To County Paris: then comes she to me,
5949:    And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
5950:    To rid her from this second marriage,
5951:    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
5952:    Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
5953:    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
5954:    As I intended, for it wrought on her
5955:    The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
5956:    That he should hither come as this dire night,
5957:    To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
5958:    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
5959:    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
5960:    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
5961:    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
5962:    At the prefixed hour of her waking,
5963:    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
5964:    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
5965:    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
5966:    But when I came, some minute ere the time
5967:    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
5968:    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
5969:    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
5970:    And bear this work of heaven with patience:
5971:    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
5972:    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
5973:    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
5974:    All this I know; and to the marriage
5975:    Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
5976:    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
5977:    Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
5978:    Unto the rigour of severest law.

5980:PRINCE

5982:    We still have known thee for a holy man.
5983:    Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

5985:BALTHASAR

5987:    I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
5988:    And then in post he came from Mantua
5989:    To this same place, to this same monument.
5990:    This letter he early bid me give his father,
5991:    And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
5992:    I departed not and left him there.

5994:PRINCE

5996:    Give me the letter; I will look on it.
5997:    Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
5998:    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

6000:PAGE

6002:    He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
6003:    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
6004:    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
6005:    And by and by my master drew on him;
6006:    And then I ran away to call the watch.

6008:PRINCE

6010:    This letter doth make good the friar's words,
6011:    Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
6012:    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
6013:    Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
6014:    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
6015:    Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
6016:    See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
6017:    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
6018:    And I for winking at your discords too
6019:    Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

6021:CAPULET

6023:    O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
6024:    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
6025:    Can I demand.

6027:MONTAGUE

6029:    But I can give thee more:
6030:    For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
6031:    That while Verona by that name is known,
6032:    There shall no figure at such rate be set
6033:    As that of true and faithful Juliet.

6035:CAPULET

6037:    As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
6038:    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

6040:PRINCE

6042:    A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
6043:    The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
6044:    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
6045:    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
6046:    For never was a story of more woe
6047:    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

6049:    Exeunt
