1: ACT I
2: PROLOGUE
3: 
4:     Two households, both alike in dignity,
5:     In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
6:     From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
7:     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
8:     From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
9:     A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
10:    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
11:    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
12:    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
13:    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
14:    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
15:    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
16:    The which if you with patient ears attend,
17:    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
18:
19:SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
20:
21:    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers 
22:
23:SAMPSON
24:
25:    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
26:
27:GREGORY
28:
29:    No, for then we should be colliers.
30:
31:SAMPSON
32:
33:    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
34:
35:GREGORY
36:
37:    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
38:
39:SAMPSON
40:
41:    I strike quickly, being moved.
42:
43:GREGORY
44:
45:    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
46:
47:SAMPSON
48:
49:    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
50:
51:GREGORY
52:
53:    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
54:    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
55:
56:SAMPSON
57:
58:    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
59:    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
60:
61:GREGORY
62:
63:    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
64:    to the wall.
65:
66:SAMPSON
67:
68:    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
69:    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
70:    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
71:    to the wall.
72:
73:GREGORY
74:
75:    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
76:
77:SAMPSON
78:
79:    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
80:    have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
81:    maids, and cut off their heads.
82:
83:GREGORY
84:
85:    The heads of the maids?
86:
87:SAMPSON
88:
89:    Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
90:    take it in what sense thou wilt.
91:
92:GREGORY
93:
94:    They must take it in sense that feel it.
95:
96:SAMPSON
97:
98:    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
99:    'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
100:
101:GREGORY
102:
103:    'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
104:    hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
105:    two of the house of the Montagues.
106:
107:SAMPSON
108:
109:    My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
110:
111:GREGORY
112:
113:    How! turn thy back and run?
114:
115:SAMPSON
116:
117:    Fear me not.
118:
119:GREGORY
120:
121:    No, marry; I fear thee!
122:
123:SAMPSON
124:
125:    Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
126:
127:GREGORY
128:
129:    I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
130:    they list.
131:
132:SAMPSON
133:
134:    Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
135:    which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
136:
137:    Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
138:
139:ABRAHAM
140:
141:    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
142:
143:SAMPSON
144:
145:    I do bite my thumb, sir.
146:
147:ABRAHAM
148:
149:    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
150:
151:SAMPSON
152:
153:    [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
154:    ay?
155:
156:GREGORY
157:
158:    No.
159:
160:SAMPSON
161:
162:    No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
163:    bite my thumb, sir.
164:
165:GREGORY
166:
167:    Do you quarrel, sir?
168:
169:ABRAHAM
170:
171:    Quarrel sir! no, sir.
172:
173:SAMPSON
174:
175:    If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
176:
177:ABRAHAM
178:
179:    No better.
180:
181:SAMPSON
182:
183:    Well, sir.
184:
185:GREGORY
186:
187:    Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
188:
189:SAMPSON
190:
191:    Yes, better, sir.
192:
193:ABRAHAM
194:
195:    You lie.
196:
197:SAMPSON
198:
199:    Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
200:
201:    They fight
202:
203:    Enter BENVOLIO
204:
205:BENVOLIO
206:
207:    Part, fools!
208:    Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
209:
210:    Beats down their swords
211:
212:    Enter TYBALT
213:
214:TYBALT
215:
216:    What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
217:    Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
218:
219:BENVOLIO
220:
221:    I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
222:    Or manage it to part these men with me.
223:
224:TYBALT
225:
226:    What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
227:    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
228:    Have at thee, coward!
229:
230:    They fight
231:
232:    Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs
233:
234:First Citizen
235:
236:    Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
237:    Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
238:
239:    Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
240:
241:CAPULET
242:
243:    What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
244:
245:LADY CAPULET
246:
247:    A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
248:
249:CAPULET
250:
251:    My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
252:    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
253:
254:    Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
255:
256:MONTAGUE
257:
258:    Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
259:
260:LADY MONTAGUE
261:
262:    Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
263:
264:    Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
265:
266:PRINCE
267:
268:    Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
269:    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
270:    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
271:    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
272:    With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
273:    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
274:    Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
275:    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
276:    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
277:    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
278:    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
279:    And made Verona's ancient citizens
280:    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
281:    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
282:    Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
283:    If ever you disturb our streets again,
284:    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
285:    For this time, all the rest depart away:
286:    You Capulet; shall go along with me:
287:    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
288:    To know our further pleasure in this case,
289:    To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
290:    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
291:
292:    Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
293:
294:MONTAGUE
295:
296:    Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
297:    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
298:
299:BENVOLIO
300:
301:    Here were the servants of your adversary,
302:    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
303:    I drew to part them: in the instant came
304:    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
305:    Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
306:    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
307:    Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
308:    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
309:    Came more and more and fought on part and part,
310:    Till the prince came, who parted either part.
311:
312:LADY MONTAGUE
313:
314:    O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
315:    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
316:
317:BENVOLIO
318:
319:    Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
320:    Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
321:    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
322:    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
323:    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
324:    So early walking did I see your son:
325:    Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
326:    And stole into the covert of the wood:
327:    I, measuring his affections by my own,
328:    That most are busied when they're most alone,
329:    Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
330:    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
331:
332:MONTAGUE
333:
334:    Many a morning hath he there been seen,
335:    With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
336:    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
337:    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
338:    Should in the furthest east begin to draw
339:    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
340:    Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
341:    And private in his chamber pens himself,
342:    Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
343:    And makes himself an artificial night:
344:    Black and portentous must this humour prove,
345:    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
346:
347:BENVOLIO
348:
349:    My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
350:
351:MONTAGUE
352:
353:    I neither know it nor can learn of him.
354:
355:BENVOLIO
356:
357:    Have you importuned him by any means?
358:
359:MONTAGUE
360:
361:    Both by myself and many other friends:
362:    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
363:    Is to himself--I will not say how true--
364:    But to himself so secret and so close,
365:    So far from sounding and discovery,
366:    As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
367:    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
368:    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
369:    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
370:    We would as willingly give cure as know.
371:
372:    Enter ROMEO
373:
374:BENVOLIO
375:
376:    See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
377:    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
378:
379:MONTAGUE
380:
381:    I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
382:    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
383:
384:    Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
385:
386:BENVOLIO
387:
388:    Good-morrow, cousin.
389:
390:ROMEO
391:
392:    Is the day so young?
393:
394:BENVOLIO
395:
396:    But new struck nine.
397:
398:ROMEO
399:
400:    Ay me! sad hours seem long.
401:    Was that my father that went hence so fast?
402:
403:BENVOLIO
404:
405:    It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
406:
407:ROMEO
408:
409:    Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
410:
411:BENVOLIO
412:
413:    In love?
414:
415:ROMEO
416:
417:    Out--
418:
419:BENVOLIO
420:
421:    Of love?
422:
423:ROMEO
424:
425:    Out of her favour, where I am in love.
426:
427:BENVOLIO
428:
429:    Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
430:    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
431:
432:ROMEO
433:
434:    Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
435:    Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
436:    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
437:    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
438:    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
439:    Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
440:    O any thing, of nothing first create!
441:    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
442:    Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
443:    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
444:    sick health!
445:    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
446:    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
447:    Dost thou not laugh?
448:
449:BENVOLIO
450:
451:    No, coz, I rather weep.
452:
453:ROMEO
454:
455:    Good heart, at what?
456:
457:BENVOLIO
458:
459:    At thy good heart's oppression.
460:
461:ROMEO
462:
463:    Why, such is love's transgression.
464:    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
465:    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
466:    With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
467:    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
468:    Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
469:    Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
470:    Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
471:    What is it else? a madness most discreet,
472:    A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
473:    Farewell, my coz.
474:
475:BENVOLIO
476:
477:    Soft! I will go along;
478:    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
479:
480:ROMEO
481:
482:    Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
483:    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
484:
485:BENVOLIO
486:
487:    Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
488:
489:ROMEO
490:
491:    What, shall I groan and tell thee?
492:
493:BENVOLIO
494:
495:    Groan! why, no.
496:    But sadly tell me who.
497:
498:ROMEO
499:
500:    Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
501:    Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
502:    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
503:
504:BENVOLIO
505:
506:    I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
507:
508:ROMEO
509:
510:    A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
511:
512:BENVOLIO
513:
514:    A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
515:
516:ROMEO
517:
518:    Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
519:    With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
520:    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
521:    From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
522:    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
523:    Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
524:    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
525:    O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
526:    That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
527:
528:BENVOLIO
529:
530:    Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
531:
532:ROMEO
533:
534:    She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
535:    For beauty starved with her severity
536:    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
537:    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
538:    To merit bliss by making me despair:
539:    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
540:    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
541:
542:BENVOLIO
543:
544:    Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
545:
546:ROMEO
547:
548:    O, teach me how I should forget to think.
549:
550:BENVOLIO
551:
552:    By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
553:    Examine other beauties.
554:
555:ROMEO
556:
557:    'Tis the way
558:    To call hers exquisite, in question more:
559:    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
560:    Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
561:    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
562:    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
563:    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
564:    What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
565:    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
566:    Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
567:
568:BENVOLIO
569:
570:    I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
571:
572:    Exeunt
573:
574:SCENE II. A street.
575:
576:    Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant 
577:
578:CAPULET
579:
580:    But Montague is bound as well as I,
581:    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
582:    For men so old as we to keep the peace.
583:
584:PARIS
585:
586:    Of honourable reckoning are you both;
587:    And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
588:    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
589:
590:CAPULET
591:
592:    But saying o'er what I have said before:
593:    My child is yet a stranger in the world;
594:    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
595:    Let two more summers wither in their pride,
596:    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
597:
598:PARIS
599:
600:    Younger than she are happy mothers made.
601:
602:CAPULET
603:
604:    And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
605:    The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
606:    She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
607:    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
608:    My will to her consent is but a part;
609:    An she agree, within her scope of choice
610:    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
611:    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
612:    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
613:    Such as I love; and you, among the store,
614:    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
615:    At my poor house look to behold this night
616:    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
617:    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
618:    When well-apparell'd April on the heel
619:    Of limping winter treads, even such delight
620:    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
621:    Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
622:    And like her most whose merit most shall be:
623:    Which on more view, of many mine being one
624:    May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
625:    Come, go with me.
626:
627:    To Servant, giving a paper
628:    Go, sirrah, trudge about
629:    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
630:    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
631:    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
632:
633:    Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
634:
635:Servant
636:
637:    Find them out whose names are written here! It is
638:    written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
639:    yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
640:    his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
641:    sent to find those persons whose names are here
642:    writ, and can never find what names the writing
643:    person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
644:
645:    Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
646:
647:BENVOLIO
648:
649:    Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
650:    One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
651:    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
652:    One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
653:    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
654:    And the rank poison of the old will die.
655:
656:ROMEO
657:
658:    Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
659:
660:BENVOLIO
661:
662:    For what, I pray thee?
663:
664:ROMEO
665:
666:    For your broken shin.
667:
668:BENVOLIO
669:
670:    Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
671:
672:ROMEO
673:
674:    Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
675:    Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
676:    Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
677:
678:Servant
679:
680:    God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
681:
682:ROMEO
683:
684:    Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
685:
686:Servant
687:
688:    Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
689:    pray, can you read any thing you see?
690:
691:ROMEO
692:
693:    Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
694:
695:Servant
696:
697:    Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
698:
699:ROMEO
700:
701:    Stay, fellow; I can read.
702:
703:    Reads
704:    'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
705:    County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
706:    widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
707:    nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
708:    uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
709:    Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
710:    Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
711:    assembly: whither should they come?
712:
713:Servant
714:
715:    Up.
716:
717:ROMEO
718:
719:    Whither?
720:
721:Servant
722:
723:    To supper; to our house.
724:
725:ROMEO
726:
727:    Whose house?
728:
729:Servant
730:
731:    My master's.
732:
733:ROMEO
734:
735:    Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
736:
737:Servant
738:
739:    Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
740:    great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
741:    of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
742:    Rest you merry!
743:
744:    Exit
745:
746:BENVOLIO
747:
748:    At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
749:    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
750:    With all the admired beauties of Verona:
751:    Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
752:    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
753:    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
754:
755:ROMEO
756:
757:    When the devout religion of mine eye
758:    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
759:    And these, who often drown'd could never die,
760:    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
761:    One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
762:    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
763:
764:BENVOLIO
765:
766:    Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
767:    Herself poised with herself in either eye:
768:    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
769:    Your lady's love against some other maid
770:    That I will show you shining at this feast,
771:    And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
772:
773:ROMEO
774:
775:    I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
776:    But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
777:

780:SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
781:
782:    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse 
783:
784:LADY CAPULET
785:
786:    Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
787:
788:Nurse
789:
790:    Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
791:    I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
792:    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
793:
794:    Enter JULIET
795:
796:JULIET
797:
798:    How now! who calls?
799:
800:Nurse
801:
802:    Your mother.
803:
804:JULIET
805:
806:    Madam, I am here.
807:    What is your will?
808:
809:LADY CAPULET
810:
811:    This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
812:    We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
813:    I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
814:    Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
815:
816:Nurse
817:
818:    Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
819:
820:LADY CAPULET
821:
822:    She's not fourteen.
823:
824:Nurse
825:
826:    I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
827:    And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
828:    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
829:    To Lammas-tide?
830:
831:LADY CAPULET
832:
833:    A fortnight and odd days.
834:
835:Nurse
836:
837:    Even or odd, of all days in the year,
838:    Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
839:    Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
840:    Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
841:    She was too good for me: but, as I said,
842:    On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
843:    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
844:    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
845:    And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
846:    Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
847:    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
848:    Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
849:    My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
850:    Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
851:    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
852:    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
853:    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
854:    Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
855:    To bid me trudge:
856:    And since that time it is eleven years;
857:    For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
858:    She could have run and waddled all about;
859:    For even the day before, she broke her brow:
860:    And then my husband--God be with his soul!
861:    A' was a merry man--took up the child:
862:    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
863:    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
864:    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
865:    The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
866:    To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
867:    I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
868:    I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
869:    And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
870:
871:LADY CAPULET
872:
873:    Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
874:
875:Nurse
876:
877:    Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
878:    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
879:    And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
880:    A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
881:    A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
882:    'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
883:    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
884:    Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
885:
886:JULIET
887:
888:    And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
889:
890:Nurse
891:
892:    Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
893:    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
894:    An I might live to see thee married once,
895:    I have my wish.
896:
897:LADY CAPULET
898:
899:    Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
900:    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
901:    How stands your disposition to be married?
902:
903:JULIET
904:
905:    It is an honour that I dream not of.
906:
907:Nurse
908:
909:    An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
910:    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
911:
912:LADY CAPULET
913:
914:    Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
915:    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
916:    Are made already mothers: by my count,
917:    I was your mother much upon these years
918:    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
919:    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
920:
921:Nurse
922:
923:    A man, young lady! lady, such a man
924:    As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
925:
926:LADY CAPULET
927:
928:    Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
929:
930:Nurse
931:
932:    Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
933:
934:LADY CAPULET
935:
936:    What say you? can you love the gentleman?
937:    This night you shall behold him at our feast;
938:    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
939:    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
940:    Examine every married lineament,
941:    And see how one another lends content
942:    And what obscured in this fair volume lies
943:    Find written in the margent of his eyes.
944:    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
945:    To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
946:    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
947:    For fair without the fair within to hide:
948:    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
949:    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
950:    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
951:    By having him, making yourself no less.
952:
953:Nurse
954:
955:    No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
956:
957:LADY CAPULET
958:
959:    Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
960:
961:JULIET
962:
963:    I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
964:    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
965:    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
966:
967:    Enter a Servant
968:
969:Servant
970:
971:    Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
972:    called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
973:    the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
974:    hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
975:
976:LADY CAPULET
977:
978:    We follow thee.
979:
980:    Exit Servant
981:    Juliet, the county stays.
982:
983:Nurse
984:
985:    Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

987:    Exeunt
988:
989:SCENE IV. A street.
990:
991:    Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others 
992:
993:ROMEO
994:
995:    What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
996:    Or shall we on without a apology?
997:
998:BENVOLIO
999:
1000:    The date is out of such prolixity:
1001:    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
1002:    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
1003:    Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
1004:    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
1005:    After the prompter, for our entrance:
1006:    But let them measure us by what they will;
1007:    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
1008:
1009:ROMEO
1010:
1011:    Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
1012:    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
1013:
1014:MERCUTIO
1015:
1016:    Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
1017:
1018:ROMEO
1019:
1020:    Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
1021:    With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
1022:    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
1023:
1024:MERCUTIO
1025:
1026:    You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
1027:    And soar with them above a common bound.
1028:
1029:ROMEO
1030:
1031:    I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
1032:    To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
1033:    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
1034:    Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
1035:
1036:MERCUTIO
1037:
1038:    And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
1039:    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
1040:
1041:ROMEO
1042:
1043:    Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
1044:    Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
1045:
1046:MERCUTIO
1047:
1048:    If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
1049:    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
1050:    Give me a case to put my visage in:
1051:    A visor for a visor! what care I
1052:    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
1053:    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
1054:
1055:BENVOLIO
1056:
1057:    Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
1058:    But every man betake him to his legs.
1059:
1060:ROMEO
1061:
1062:    A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
1063:    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
1064:    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
1065:    I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
1066:    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
1067:
1068:MERCUTIO
1069:
1070:    Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
1071:    If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
1072:    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
1073:    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
1074:
1075:ROMEO
1076:
1077:    Nay, that's not so.
1078:
1079:MERCUTIO
1080:
1081:    I mean, sir, in delay
1082:    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
1083:    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
1084:    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
1085:
1086:ROMEO
1087:
1088:    And we mean well in going to this mask;
1089:    But 'tis no wit to go.
1090:
1091:MERCUTIO
1092:
1093:    Why, may one ask?
1094:
1095:ROMEO
1096:
1097:    I dream'd a dream to-night.
1098:
1099:MERCUTIO
1100:
1101:    And so did I.
1102:
1103:ROMEO
1104:
1105:    Well, what was yours?
1106:
1107:MERCUTIO
1108:
1109:    That dreamers often lie.
1110:
1111:ROMEO
1112:
1113:    In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
1114:
1115:MERCUTIO
1116:
1117:    O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
1118:    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
1119:    In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
1120:    On the fore-finger of an alderman,
1121:    Drawn with a team of little atomies
1122:    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
1123:    Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
1124:    The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
1125:    The traces of the smallest spider's web,
1126:    The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
1127:    Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
1128:    Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
1129:    Not so big as a round little worm
1130:    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
1131:    Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
1132:    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
1133:    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
1134:    And in this state she gallops night by night
1135:    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
1136:    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
1137:    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
1138:    O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
1139:    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
1140:    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
1141:    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
1142:    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
1143:    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
1144:    Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
1145:    Then dreams, he of another benefice:
1146:    Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
1147:    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
1148:    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
1149:    Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
1150:    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
1151:    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
1152:    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
1153:    That plats the manes of horses in the night,
1154:    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
1155:    Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
1156:    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
1157:    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
1158:    Making them women of good carriage:
1159:    This is she--
1160:
1161:ROMEO
1162:
1163:    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
1164:    Thou talk'st of nothing.
1165:
1166:MERCUTIO
1167:
1168:    True, I talk of dreams,
1169:    Which are the children of an idle brain,
1170:    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
1171:    Which is as thin of substance as the air
1172:    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
1173:    Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
1174:    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
1175:    Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
1176:
1177:BENVOLIO
1178:
1179:    This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
1180:    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
1181:
1182:ROMEO
1183:
1184:    I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
1185:    Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
1186:    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
1187:    With this night's revels and expire the term
1188:    Of a despised life closed in my breast
1189:    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
1190:    But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
1191:    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
1192:
1193:BENVOLIO
1194:
1195:    Strike, drum.
1196:
1197:    Exeunt
1198:
1199:SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
1200:
1201:    Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins 
1202:
1203:First Servant
1204:
1205:    Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
1206:    shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
1207:
1208:Second Servant
1209:
1210:    When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
1211:    hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
1212:
1213:First Servant
1214:
1215:    Away with the joint-stools, remove the
1216:    court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
1217:    me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
1218:    the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
1219:    Antony, and Potpan!
1220:
1221:Second Servant
1222:
1223:    Ay, boy, ready.
1224:
1225:First Servant
1226:
1227:    You are looked for and called for, asked for and
1228:    sought for, in the great chamber.
1229:
1230:Second Servant
1231:
1232:    We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
1233:    brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
1234:
1235:    Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
1236:
1237:CAPULET
1238:
1239:    Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
1240:    Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
1241:    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
1242:    Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
1243:    She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
1244:    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
1245:    That I have worn a visor and could tell
1246:    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
1247:    Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
1248:    You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
1249:    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
1250:
1251:    Music plays, and they dance
1252:    More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
1253:    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
1254:    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
1255:    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
1256:    For you and I are past our dancing days:
1257:    How long is't now since last yourself and I
1258:    Were in a mask?
1259:
1260:Second Capulet
1261:
1262:    By'r lady, thirty years.
1263:
1264:CAPULET
1265:
1266:    What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
1267:    'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
1268:    Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
1269:    Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
1270:
1271:Second Capulet
1272:
1273:    'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
1274:    His son is thirty.
1275:
1276:CAPULET
1277:
1278:    Will you tell me that?
1279:    His son was but a ward two years ago.
1280:
1281:ROMEO
1282:
1283:    [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
1284:    enrich the hand
1285:    Of yonder knight?
1286:
1287:Servant
1288:
1289:    I know not, sir.
1290:
1291:ROMEO
1292:
1293:    O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
1294:    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
1295:    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
1296:    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
1297:    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
1298:    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
1299:    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
1300:    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
1301:    Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
1302:    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
1303:
1304:TYBALT
1305:
1306:    This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
1307:    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
1308:    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
1309:    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
1310:    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
1311:    To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
1312:
1313:CAPULET
1314:
1315:    Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
1316:
1317:TYBALT
1318:
1319:    Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
1320:    A villain that is hither come in spite,
1321:    To scorn at our solemnity this night.
1322:
1323:CAPULET
1324:
1325:    Young Romeo is it?
1326:
1327:TYBALT
1328:
1329:    'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
1330:
1331:CAPULET
1332:
1333:    Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
1334:    He bears him like a portly gentleman;
1335:    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
1336:    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
1337:    I would not for the wealth of all the town
1338:    Here in my house do him disparagement:
1339:    Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
1340:    It is my will, the which if thou respect,
1341:    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
1342:    And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
1343:
1344:TYBALT
1345:
1346:    It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
1347:    I'll not endure him.
1348:
1349:CAPULET
1350:
1351:    He shall be endured:
1352:    What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
1353:    Am I the master here, or you? go to.
1354:    You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
1355:    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
1356:    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
1357:
1358:TYBALT
1359:
1360:    Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
1361:
1362:CAPULET
1363:
1364:    Go to, go to;
1365:    You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
1366:    This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
1367:    You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
1368:    Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
1369:    Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
1370:    I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
1371:
1372:TYBALT
1373:
1374:    Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
1375:    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
1376:    I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
1377:    Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
1378:
1379:    Exit
1380:
1381:ROMEO
1382:
1383:    [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
1384:    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
1385:    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
1386:    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
1387:
1388:JULIET
1389:
1390:    Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
1391:    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
1392:    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
1393:    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
1394:
1395:ROMEO
1396:
1397:    Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
1398:
1399:JULIET
1400:
1401:    Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
1402:
1403:ROMEO
1404:
1405:    O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
1406:    They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
1407:
1408:JULIET
1409:
1410:    Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
1411:
1412:ROMEO
1413:
1414:    Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
1415:    Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
1416:
1417:JULIET
1418:
1419:    Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
1420:
1421:ROMEO
1422:
1423:    Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
1424:    Give me my sin again.
1425:
1426:JULIET
1427:
1428:    You kiss by the book.
1429:
1430:Nurse
1431:
1432:    Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
1433:
1434:ROMEO
1435:
1436:    What is her mother?
1437:
1438:Nurse
1439:
1440:    Marry, bachelor,
1441:    Her mother is the lady of the house,
1442:    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
1443:    I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
1444:    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
1445:    Shall have the chinks.
1446:
1447:ROMEO
1448:
1449:    Is she a Capulet?
1450:    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
1451:
1452:BENVOLIO
1453:
1454:    Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
1455:
1456:ROMEO
1457:
1458:    Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
1459:
1460:CAPULET
1461:
1462:    Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
1463:    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
1464:    Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
1465:    I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
1466:    More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
1467:    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
1468:    I'll to my rest.
1469:
1470:    Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
1471:
1472:JULIET
1473:
1474:    Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
1475:
1476:Nurse
1477:
1478:    The son and heir of old Tiberio.
1479:
1480:JULIET
1481:
1482:    What's he that now is going out of door?
1483:
1484:Nurse
1485:
1486:    Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
1487:
1488:JULIET
1489:
1490:    What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
1491:
1492:Nurse
1493:
1494:    I know not.
1495:
1496:JULIET
1497:
1498:    Go ask his name: if he be married.
1499:    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1500:
1501:Nurse
1502:
1503:    His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1504:    The only son of your great enemy.
1505:
1506:JULIET
1507:
1508:    My only love sprung from my only hate!
1509:    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1510:    Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1511:    That I must love a loathed enemy.
1512:
1513:Nurse
1514:
1515:    What's this? what's this?
1516:
1517:JULIET
1518:
1519:    A rhyme I learn'd even now
1520:    Of one I danced withal.
1521:
1522:    One calls within 'Juliet.'
1523:
1524:Nurse
1525:
1526:    Anon, anon!
1527:    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
1528:
1529:    Exeunt

1531:ACT II
1532:PROLOGUE
1533:
1534:    Enter Chorus 
1535:
1536:Chorus
1537:
1538:    Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1539:    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1540:    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1541:    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1542:    Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1543:    Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1544:    But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1545:    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1546:    Being held a foe, he may not have access
1547:    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1548:    And she as much in love, her means much less
1549:    To meet her new-beloved any where:
1550:    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1551:    Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
1552:
1553:    Exit
1554:
1555:SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
1556:
1557:    Enter ROMEO 
1558:
1559:ROMEO
1560:
1561:    Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1562:    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
1563:
1564:    He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
1565:
1566:    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
1567:
1568:BENVOLIO
1569:
1570:    Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
1571:
1572:MERCUTIO
1573:
1574:    He is wise;
1575:    And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1576:
1577:BENVOLIO
1578:
1579:    He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1580:    Call, good Mercutio.
1581:
1582:MERCUTIO
1583:
1584:    Nay, I'll conjure too.
1585:    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1586:    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1587:    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1588:    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1589:    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1590:    One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1591:    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1592:    When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1593:    He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1594:    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1595:    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1596:    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1597:    By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1598:    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1599:    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1600:
1601:BENVOLIO
1602:
1603:    And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1604:
1605:MERCUTIO
1606:
1607:    This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1608:    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1609:    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1610:    Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1611:    That were some spite: my invocation
1612:    Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
1613:    I conjure only but to raise up him.
1614:
1615:BENVOLIO
1616:
1617:    Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1618:    To be consorted with the humorous night:
1619:    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1620:
1621:MERCUTIO
1622:
1623:    If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1624:    Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1625:    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1626:    As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1627:    Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1628:    An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1629:    Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1630:    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1631:    Come, shall we go?
1632:
1633:BENVOLIO
1634:
1635:    Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1636:    To seek him here that means not to be found.
1637:
1638:    Exeunt
1639:
1640:SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
1641:
1642:    Enter ROMEO 
1643:
1644:ROMEO
1645:
1646:    He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1647:
1648:    JULIET appears above at a window
1649:    But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1650:    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1651:    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1652:    Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1653:    That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1654:    Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1655:    Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1656:    And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1657:    It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1658:    O, that she knew she were!
1659:    She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1660:    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1661:    I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1662:    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1663:    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1664:    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1665:    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1666:    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1667:    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1668:    Would through the airy region stream so bright
1669:    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1670:    See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1671:    O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1672:    That I might touch that cheek!
1673:
1674:JULIET
1675:
1676:    Ay me!
1677:
1678:ROMEO
1679:
1680:    She speaks:
1681:    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1682:    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1683:    As is a winged messenger of heaven
1684:    Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1685:    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1686:    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1687:    And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1688:
1689:JULIET
1690:
1691:    O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1692:    Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1693:    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1694:    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1695:
1696:ROMEO
1697:
1698:    [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1699:
1700:JULIET
1701:
1702:    'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1703:    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1704:    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1705:    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1706:    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1707:    What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1708:    By any other name would smell as sweet;
1709:    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1710:    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1711:    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1712:    And for that name which is no part of thee
1713:    Take all myself.
1714:
1715:ROMEO
1716:
1717:    I take thee at thy word:
1718:    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1719:    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1720:
1721:JULIET
1722:
1723:    What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1724:    So stumblest on my counsel?
1725:
1726:ROMEO
1727:
1728:    By a name
1729:    I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1730:    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1731:    Because it is an enemy to thee;
1732:    Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1733:
1734:JULIET
1735:
1736:    My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1737:    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1738:    Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1739:
1740:ROMEO
1741:
1742:    Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1743:
1744:JULIET
1745:
1746:    How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1747:    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1748:    And the place death, considering who thou art,
1749:    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1750:
1751:ROMEO
1752:
1753:    With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1754:    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1755:    And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1756:    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1757:
1758:JULIET
1759:
1760:    If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1761:
1762:ROMEO
1763:
1764:    Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1765:    Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1766:    And I am proof against their enmity.
1767:
1768:JULIET
1769:
1770:    I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1771:
1772:ROMEO
1773:
1774:    I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1775:    And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1776:    My life were better ended by their hate,
1777:    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1778:
1779:JULIET
1780:
1781:    By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1782:
1783:ROMEO
1784:
1785:    By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1786:    He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1787:    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1788:    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1789:    I would adventure for such merchandise.
1790:
1791:JULIET
1792:
1793:    Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1794:    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1795:    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1796:    Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1797:    What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1798:    Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1799:    And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1800:    Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1801:    Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1802:    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1803:    Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1804:    I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1805:    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1806:    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1807:    And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1808:    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1809:    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1810:    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1811:    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1812:    My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1813:    And not impute this yielding to light love,
1814:    Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1815:
1816:ROMEO
1817:
1818:    Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1819:    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1820:
1821:JULIET
1822:
1823:    O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1824:    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1825:    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1826:
1827:ROMEO
1828:
1829:    What shall I swear by?
1830:
1831:JULIET
1832:
1833:    Do not swear at all;
1834:    Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1835:    Which is the god of my idolatry,
1836:    And I'll believe thee.
1837:
1838:ROMEO
1839:
1840:    If my heart's dear love--
1841:
1842:JULIET
1843:
1844:    Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1845:    I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1846:    It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1847:    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1848:    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1849:    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1850:    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1851:    Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1852:    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1853:
1854:ROMEO
1855:
1856:    O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1857:
1858:JULIET
1859:
1860:    What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1861:
1862:ROMEO
1863:
1864:    The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1865:
1866:JULIET
1867:
1868:    I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1869:    And yet I would it were to give again.
1870:
1871:ROMEO
1872:
1873:    Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1874:
1875:JULIET
1876:
1877:    But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1878:    And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1879:    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1880:    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1881:    The more I have, for both are infinite.
1882:
1883:    Nurse calls within
1884:    I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1885:    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1886:    Stay but a little, I will come again.
1887:
1888:    Exit, above

1890:ROMEO
1891:
1892:    O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1893:    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1894:    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1895:
1896:    Re-enter JULIET, above
1897:
1898:JULIET
1899:
1900:    Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1901:    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1902:    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1903:    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1904:    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1905:    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1906:    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

1909:
1910:    [Within] Madam!
1911:
1912:JULIET
1913:

1915:    I do beseech thee--
1916:
1917:Nurse
1918:
1919:    [Within] Madam!
1920:
1921:JULIET
1922:
1923:    By and by, I come:--
1924:    To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1925:    To-morrow will I send.
1926:
1927:ROMEO
1928:
1929:    So thrive my soul--
1930:
1931:JULIET
1932:
1933:    A thousand times good night!
1934:
1935:    Exit, above
1936:
1937:ROMEO
1938:
1939:    A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1940:    Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1941:    their books,
1942:    But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

1949:
1950:    Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1951:    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1952:    Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1953:    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1954:    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1955:    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1956:
1957:ROMEO
1958:
1959:    It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1960:    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1961:    Like softest music to attending ears!
1962:
1963:JULIET
1964:
1965:    Romeo!

1970:
1971:JULIET
1972:
1973:    At what o'clock to-morrow
1974:    Shall I send to thee?
1975:
1976:ROMEO
1977:
1978:    At the hour of nine.
1979:
1980:JULIET
1981:
1982:    I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1983:    I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1984:
1985:ROMEO
1986:
1987:    Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1988:
1989:JULIET
1990:
1991:    I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1992:    Remembering how I love thy company.
1993:
1994:ROMEO
1995:
1996:    And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1997:    Forgetting any other home but this.
1998:
1999:JULIET
2000:
2001:    'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
2002:    And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
2003:    Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
2004:    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
2005:    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
2006:    So loving-jealous of his liberty.
2007:
2008:ROMEO
2009:
2010:    I would I were thy bird.
2011:
2012:JULIET
2013:
2014:    Sweet, so would I:
2015:    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
2016:    Good night, good night! parting is such
2017:    sweet sorrow,
2018:    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
2019:
2020:    Exit above
2021:
2022:ROMEO
2023:
2024:    Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
2025:    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
2026:    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
2027:    His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
2028:

2032:
2033:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket 
2034:
2035:FRIAR LAURENCE
2036:
2037:    The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
2038:    Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
2039:    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
2040:    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
2041:    Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
2042:    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
2043:    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
2044:    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
2045:    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
2046:    What is her burying grave that is her womb,
2047:    And from her womb children of divers kind
2048:    We sucking on her natural bosom find,
2049:    Many for many virtues excellent,
2050:    None but for some and yet all different.
2051:    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
2052:    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
2053:    For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
2054:    But to the earth some special good doth give,
2055:    Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
2056:    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
2057:    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
2058:    And vice sometimes by action dignified.
2059:    Within the infant rind of this small flower
2060:    Poison hath residence and medicine power:
2061:    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
2062:    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
2063:    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
2064:    In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
2065:    And where the worser is predominant,
2066:    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
2067:
2068:    Enter ROMEO
2069:
2070:ROMEO
2071:
2072:    Good morrow, father.
2073:
2074:FRIAR LAURENCE
2075:
2076:    Benedicite!
2077:    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
2078:    Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
2079:    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
2080:    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
2081:    And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
2082:    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
2083:    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
2084:    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
2085:    Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
2086:    Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
2087:    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
2088:
2089:ROMEO
2090:
2091:    That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
2092:
2093:FRIAR LAURENCE
2094:
2095:    God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
2096:
2097:ROMEO
2098:
2099:    With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
2100:    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
2101:
2102:FRIAR LAURENCE
2103:
2104:    That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
2105:
2106:ROMEO
2107:
2108:    I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
2109:    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
2110:    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
2111:    That's by me wounded: both our remedies
2112:    Within thy help and holy physic lies:
2113:    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
2114:    My intercession likewise steads my foe.
2115:
2116:FRIAR LAURENCE
2117:
2118:    Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
2119:    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
2120:
2121:ROMEO
2122:
2123:    Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
2124:    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
2125:    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
2126:    And all combined, save what thou must combine
2127:    By holy marriage: when and where and how
2128:    We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
2129:    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
2130:    That thou consent to marry us to-day.
2131:
2132:FRIAR LAURENCE
2133:
2134:    Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
2135:    Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
2136:    So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
2137:    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
2138:    Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
2139:    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
2140:    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
2141:    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
2142:    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
2143:    Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
2144:    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
2145:    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
2146:    If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
2147:    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
2148:    And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
2149:    Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
2150:
2151:ROMEO
2152:
2153:    Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
2154:
2155:FRIAR LAURENCE
2156:
2157:    For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
2158:
2159:ROMEO
2160:
2161:    And bad'st me bury love.
2162:
2163:FRIAR LAURENCE
2164:
2165:    Not in a grave,
2166:    To lay one in, another out to have.
2167:
2168:ROMEO
2169:
2170:    I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
2171:    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
2172:    The other did not so.
2173:
2174:FRIAR LAURENCE
2175:
2176:    O, she knew well
2177:    Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
2178:    But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
2179:    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
2180:    For this alliance may so happy prove,
2181:    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
2182:
2183:ROMEO
2184:
2185:    O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
2186:
2187:FRIAR LAURENCE
2188:
2189:    Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
2190:

2194:
2195:    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO 
2196:
2197:MERCUTIO
2198:
2199:    Where the devil should this Romeo be?
2200:    Came he not home to-night?
2201:
2202:BENVOLIO
2203:
2204:    Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
2205:
2206:MERCUTIO
2207:
2208:    Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
2209:    Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
2210:
2211:BENVOLIO
2212:
2213:    Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
2214:    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

2217:
2218:    A challenge, on my life.
2219:
2220:BENVOLIO
2221:
2222:    Romeo will answer it.
2223:
2224:MERCUTIO
2225:
2226:    Any man that can write may answer a letter.
2227:
2228:BENVOLIO
2229:
2230:    Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
2231:    dares, being dared.
2232:
2233:MERCUTIO
2234:
2235:    Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
2236:    white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
2237:    love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
2238:    blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
2239:    encounter Tybalt?
2240:
2241:BENVOLIO
2242:
2243:    Why, what is Tybalt?
2244:
2245:MERCUTIO
2246:
2247:    More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
2248:    the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
2249:    you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
2250:    proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
2251:    the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
2252:    button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
2253:    very first house, of the first and second cause:
2254:    ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
2255:    hai!
2256:
2257:BENVOLIO
2258:
2259:    The what?
2260:
2261:MERCUTIO
2262:
2263:    The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
2264:    fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
2265:    a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
2266:    whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
2267:    grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
2268:    these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
2269:    perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
2270:    that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
2271:    bones, their bones!
2272:
2273:    Enter ROMEO
2274:
2275:BENVOLIO
2276:
2277:    Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
2278:
2279:MERCUTIO
2280:
2281:    Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
2282:    how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
2283:    that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
2284:    kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
2285:    be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
2286:    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
2287:    eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
2288:    Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
2289:    to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
2290:    fairly last night.
2291:
2292:ROMEO
2293:
2294:    Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
2295:
2296:MERCUTIO
2297:
2298:    The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
2299:
2300:ROMEO
2301:
2302:    Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
2303:    such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
2304:
2305:MERCUTIO
2306:
2307:    That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
2308:    constrains a man to bow in the hams.
2309:
2310:ROMEO
2311:
2312:    Meaning, to court'sy.
2313:
2314:MERCUTIO
2315:
2316:    Thou hast most kindly hit it.
2317:
2318:ROMEO
2319:
2320:    A most courteous exposition.
2321:
2322:MERCUTIO
2323:
2324:    Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
2325:
2326:ROMEO
2327:
2328:    Pink for flower.
2329:
2330:MERCUTIO
2331:
2332:    Right.
2333:
2334:ROMEO
2335:
2336:    Why, then is my pump well flowered.
2337:
2338:MERCUTIO
2339:
2340:    Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
2341:    worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
2342:    is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
2343:
2344:ROMEO
2345:
2346:    O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
2347:    singleness.
2348:
2349:MERCUTIO
2350:
2351:    Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
2352:
2353:ROMEO
2354:
2355:    Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
2356:
2357:MERCUTIO
2358:
2359:    Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
2360:    done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
2361:    thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
2362:    was I with you there for the goose?
2363:
2364:ROMEO
2365:
2366:    Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
2367:    not there for the goose.
2368:
2369:MERCUTIO
2370:
2371:    I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
2372:
2373:ROMEO
2374:
2375:    Nay, good goose, bite not.
2376:
2377:MERCUTIO
2378:
2379:    Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
2380:    sharp sauce.
2381:
2382:ROMEO
2383:
2384:    And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
2385:
2386:MERCUTIO
2387:
2388:    O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
2389:    inch narrow to an ell broad!
2390:
2391:ROMEO
2392:
2393:    I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
2394:    to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
2395:
2396:MERCUTIO
2397:
2398:    Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
2399:    now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
2400:    thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
2401:    for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
2402:    that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
2403:
2404:BENVOLIO
2405:
2406:    Stop there, stop there.
2407:
2408:MERCUTIO
2409:
2410:    Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
2411:
2412:BENVOLIO
2413:
2414:    Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
2415:
2416:MERCUTIO
2417:
2418:    O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
2419:    for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
2420:    meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
2421:
2422:ROMEO
2423:
2424:    Here's goodly gear!
2425:
2426:    Enter Nurse and PETER
2427:
2428:MERCUTIO
2429:
2430:    A sail, a sail!
2431:
2432:BENVOLIO
2433:
2434:    Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
2435:
2436:Nurse
2437:
2438:    Peter!
2439:
2440:PETER
2441:
2442:    Anon!
2443:
2444:Nurse
2445:
2446:    My fan, Peter.
2447:
2448:MERCUTIO
2449:
2450:    Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
2451:    fairer face.
2452:
2453:Nurse
2454:
2455:    God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
2456:
2457:MERCUTIO
2458:
2459:    God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
2460:
2461:Nurse
2462:
2463:    Is it good den?
2464:
2465:MERCUTIO
2466:
2467:    'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
2468:    dial is now upon the prick of noon.
2469:
2470:Nurse
2471:
2472:    Out upon you! what a man are you!
2473:
2474:ROMEO
2475:
2476:    One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
2477:    mar.
2478:
2479:Nurse
2480:
2481:    By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
2482:    quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
2483:    may find the young Romeo?
2484:
2485:ROMEO
2486:
2487:    I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
2488:    you have found him than he was when you sought him:
2489:    I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
2490:
2491:Nurse
2492:
2493:    You say well.
2494:
2495:MERCUTIO
2496:
2497:    Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
2498:    wisely, wisely.
2499:
2500:Nurse
2501:
2502:    if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
2503:    you.
2504:
2505:BENVOLIO
2506:
2507:    She will indite him to some supper.
2508:
2509:MERCUTIO
2510:
2511:    A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
2512:
2513:ROMEO
2514:
2515:    What hast thou found?
2516:
2517:MERCUTIO
2518:
2519:    No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
2520:    that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
2521:
2522:    Sings
2523:    An old hare hoar,
2524:    And an old hare hoar,
2525:    Is very good meat in lent
2526:    But a hare that is hoar
2527:    Is too much for a score,
2528:    When it hoars ere it be spent.
2529:    Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
2530:    to dinner, thither.
2531:
2532:ROMEO
2533:
2534:    I will follow you.
2535:
2536:MERCUTIO
2537:
2538:    Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
2539:
2540:    Singing
2541:    'lady, lady, lady.'
2542:
2543:    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
2544:
2545:Nurse
2546:
2547:    Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
2548:    merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
2549:
2550:ROMEO
2551:
2552:    A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
2553:    and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
2554:    to in a month.
2555:
2556:Nurse
2557:
2558:    An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
2559:    down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
2560:    Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
2561:    Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
2562:    none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
2563:    too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
2564:
2565:PETER
2566:
2567:    I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
2568:    should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
2569:    draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
2570:    good quarrel, and the law on my side.
2571:
2572:Nurse
2573:
2574:    Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
2575:    me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
2576:    and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
2577:    out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
2578:    but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
2579:    a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
2580:    kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
2581:    is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
2582:    with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
2583:    to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
2584:
2585:ROMEO
2586:
2587:    Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
2588:    protest unto thee--
2589:
2590:Nurse
2591:
2592:    Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
2593:    Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
2594:
2595:ROMEO
2596:
2597:    What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
2598:
2599:Nurse
2600:
2601:    I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
2602:    I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
2603:
2604:ROMEO
2605:
2606:    Bid her devise
2607:    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
2608:    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
2609:    Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
2610:
2611:Nurse
2612:
2613:    No truly sir; not a penny.
2614:
2615:ROMEO
2616:
2617:    Go to; I say you shall.
2618:
2619:Nurse
2620:
2621:    This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
2622:
2623:ROMEO
2624:
2625:    And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
2626:    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
2627:    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
2628:    Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
2629:    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2630:    Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
2631:    Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
2632:
2633:Nurse
2634:
2635:    Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
2636:
2637:ROMEO
2638:
2639:    What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
2640:
2641:Nurse
2642:
2643:    Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
2644:    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
2645:
2646:ROMEO
2647:
2648:    I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
2649:
2650:NURSE
2651:
2652:    Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
2653:    Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
2654:    is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
2655:    lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
2656:    see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
2657:    sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
2658:    man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
2659:    as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
2660:    rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
2661:
2662:ROMEO
2663:
2664:    Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
2665:
2666:Nurse
2667:
2668:    Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
2669:    the--No; I know it begins with some other
2670:    letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
2671:    it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
2672:    to hear it.
2673:
2674:ROMEO
2675:
2676:    Commend me to thy lady.
2677:
2678:Nurse
2679:
2680:    Ay, a thousand times.
2681:
2682:    Exit Romeo
2683:    Peter!
2684:
2685:PETER
2686:
2687:    Anon!
2688:
2689:Nurse
2690:
2691:    Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
2692:
2693:    Exeunt
2694:
2695:SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
2696:
2697:    Enter JULIET 
2698:
2699:JULIET
2700:
2701:    The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
2702:    In half an hour she promised to return.
2703:    Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
2704:    O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
2705:    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
2706:    Driving back shadows over louring hills:
2707:    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
2708:    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2709:    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2710:    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
2711:    Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
2712:    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2713:    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
2714:    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2715:    And his to me:
2716:    But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
2717:    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
2718:    O God, she comes!
2719:
2720:    Enter Nurse and PETER
2721:    O honey nurse, what news?
2722:    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
2723:
2724:Nurse
2725:
2726:    Peter, stay at the gate.
2727:
2728:    Exit PETER
2729:
2730:JULIET
2731:
2732:    Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
2733:    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
2734:    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
2735:    By playing it to me with so sour a face.
2736:
2737:Nurse
2738:
2739:    I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
2740:    Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
2741:
2742:JULIET
2743:
2744:    I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
2745:    Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
2746:
2747:Nurse
2748:
2749:    Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
2750:    Do you not see that I am out of breath?
2751:
2752:JULIET
2753:
2754:    How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
2755:    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2756:    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2757:    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2758:    Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
2759:    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
2760:    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
2761:
2762:Nurse
2763:
2764:    Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
2765:    how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
2766:    face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
2767:    all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
2768:    though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
2769:    past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
2770:    but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
2771:    ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
2772:
2773:JULIET
2774:
2775:    No, no: but all this did I know before.
2776:    What says he of our marriage? what of that?
2777:
2778:Nurse
2779:
2780:    Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
2781:    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2782:    My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
2783:    Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
2784:    To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
2785:
2786:JULIET
2787:
2788:    I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2789:    Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
2790:
2791:Nurse
2792:
2793:    Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
2794:    courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
2795:    warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
2796:
2797:JULIET
2798:
2799:    Where is my mother! why, she is within;
2800:    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
2801:    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2802:    Where is your mother?'
2803:
2804:Nurse
2805:
2806:    O God's lady dear!
2807:    Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
2808:    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2809:    Henceforward do your messages yourself.
2810:
2811:JULIET
2812:
2813:    Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
2814:
2815:Nurse
2816:
2817:    Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
2818:
2819:JULIET
2820:
2821:    I have.
2822:
2823:Nurse
2824:
2825:    Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
2826:    There stays a husband to make you a wife:
2827:    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
2828:    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2829:    Hie you to church; I must another way,
2830:    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
2831:    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
2832:    I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
2833:    But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
2834:    Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
2835:
2836:JULIET
2837:
2838:    Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
2839:
2840:    Exeunt
2841:
2842:SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
2843:
2844:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO 
2845:
2846:FRIAR LAURENCE
2847:
2848:    So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
2849:    That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
2850:
2851:ROMEO
2852:
2853:    Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
2854:    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2855:    That one short minute gives me in her sight:
2856:    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2857:    Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
2858:    It is enough I may but call her mine.
2859:
2860:FRIAR LAURENCE
2861:
2862:    These violent delights have violent ends
2863:    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
2864:    Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
2865:    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
2866:    And in the taste confounds the appetite:
2867:    Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
2868:    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
2869:
2870:    Enter JULIET
2871:    Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
2872:    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
2873:    A lover may bestride the gossamer
2874:    That idles in the wanton summer air,
2875:    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
2876:
2877:JULIET
2878:
2879:    Good even to my ghostly confessor.
2880:
2881:FRIAR LAURENCE
2882:
2883:    Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
2884:
2885:JULIET
2886:
2887:    As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
2888:
2889:ROMEO
2890:
2891:    Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2892:    Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
2893:    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2894:    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
2895:    Unfold the imagined happiness that both
2896:    Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2897:
2898:JULIET
2899:
2900:    Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2901:    Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
2902:    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2903:    But my true love is grown to such excess
2904:    I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2905:
2906:FRIAR LAURENCE
2907:
2908:    Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2909:    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2910:    Till holy church incorporate two in one.
2911:
2912:    Exeunt
2913:
2914:ACT III
2915:SCENE I. A public place.
2916:
2917:    Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants 
2918:
2919:BENVOLIO
2920:
2921:    I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
2922:    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
2923:    And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
2924:    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2925:
2926:MERCUTIO
2927:
2928:    Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
2929:    enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
2930:    upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
2931:    thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
2932:    it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
2933:
2934:BENVOLIO
2935:
2936:    Am I like such a fellow?
2937:
2938:MERCUTIO
2939:
2940:    Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
2941:    any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
2942:    soon moody to be moved.
2943:
2944:BENVOLIO
2945:
2946:    And what to?
2947:
2948:MERCUTIO
2949:
2950:    Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
2951:    shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
2952:    thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
2953:    or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
2954:    wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2955:    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
2956:    eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
2957:    Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
2958:    meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
2959:    an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
2960:    man for coughing in the street, because he hath
2961:    wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
2962:    didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
2963:    his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
2964:    tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
2965:    wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
2966:
2967:BENVOLIO
2968:
2969:    An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
2970:    should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
2971:
2972:MERCUTIO
2973:
2974:    The fee-simple! O simple!
2975:
2976:BENVOLIO
2977:
2978:    By my head, here come the Capulets.
2979:
2980:MERCUTIO
2981:
2982:    By my heel, I care not.
2983:
2984:    Enter TYBALT and others
2985:
2986:TYBALT
2987:
2988:    Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2989:    Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2990:
2991:MERCUTIO
2992:
2993:    And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2994:    something; make it a word and a blow.
2995:
2996:TYBALT
2997:
2998:    You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2999:    will give me occasion.
3000:
3001:MERCUTIO
3002:
3003:    Could you not take some occasion without giving?
3004:
3005:TYBALT
3006:
3007:    Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
3008:
3009:MERCUTIO
3010:
3011:    Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
3012:    thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
3013:    discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
3014:    make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
3015:
3016:BENVOLIO
3017:
3018:    We talk here in the public haunt of men:
3019:    Either withdraw unto some private place,
3020:    And reason coldly of your grievances,
3021:    Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
3022:
3023:MERCUTIO
3024:
3025:    Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
3026:    I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
3027:
3028:    Enter ROMEO
3029:
3030:TYBALT
3031:
3032:    Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
3033:
3034:MERCUTIO
3035:
3036:    But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
3037:    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
3038:    Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
3039:
3040:TYBALT
3041:
3042:    Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
3043:    No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
3044:
3045:ROMEO
3046:
3047:    Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
3048:    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
3049:    To such a greeting: villain am I none;
3050:    Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
3051:
3052:TYBALT
3053:
3054:    Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
3055:    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
3056:
3057:ROMEO
3058:
3059:    I do protest, I never injured thee,
3060:    But love thee better than thou canst devise,
3061:    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
3062:    And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
3063:    As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
3064:
3065:MERCUTIO
3066:
3067:    O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
3068:    Alla stoccata carries it away.
3069:
3070:    Draws
3071:    Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
3072:
3073:TYBALT
3074:
3075:    What wouldst thou have with me?
3076:
3077:MERCUTIO
3078:
3079:    Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
3080:    lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
3081:    shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
3082:    eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
3083:    by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
3084:    ears ere it be out.
3085:
3086:TYBALT
3087:
3088:    I am for you.
3089:
3090:    Drawing
3091:
3092:ROMEO
3093:
3094:    Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
3095:
3096:MERCUTIO
3097:
3098:    Come, sir, your passado.
3099:
3100:    They fight
3101:
3102:ROMEO
3103:
3104:    Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
3105:    Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
3106:    Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
3107:    Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
3108:    Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
3109:
3110:    TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
3111:
3112:MERCUTIO
3113:
3114:    I am hurt.
3115:    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
3116:    Is he gone, and hath nothing?
3117:
3118:BENVOLIO
3119:
3120:    What, art thou hurt?
3121:
3122:MERCUTIO
3123:
3124:    Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
3125:    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
3126:
3127:    Exit Page
3128:
3129:ROMEO
3130:
3131:    Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
3132:
3133:MERCUTIO
3134:
3135:    No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
3136:    church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
3137:    me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
3138:    am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
3139:    both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
3140:    cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
3141:    rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
3142:    arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
3143:    was hurt under your arm.
3144:
3145:ROMEO
3146:
3147:    I thought all for the best.
3148:
3149:MERCUTIO
3150:
3151:    Help me into some house, Benvolio,
3152:    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
3153:    They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
3154:    And soundly too: your houses!
3155:
3156:    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
3157:
3158:ROMEO
3159:
3160:    This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
3161:    My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
3162:    In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
3163:    With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
3164:    Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
3165:    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
3166:    And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
3167:
3168:    Re-enter BENVOLIO
3169:
3170:BENVOLIO
3171:
3172:    O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
3173:    That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
3174:    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
3175:
3176:ROMEO
3177:
3178:    This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
3179:    This but begins the woe, others must end.
3180:
3181:BENVOLIO
3182:
3183:    Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
3184:
3185:ROMEO
3186:
3187:    Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
3188:    Away to heaven, respective lenity,
3189:    And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
3190:
3191:    Re-enter TYBALT
3192:    Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
3193:    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
3194:    Is but a little way above our heads,
3195:    Staying for thine to keep him company:
3196:    Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
3197:
3198:TYBALT
3199:
3200:    Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
3201:    Shalt with him hence.
3202:
3203:ROMEO
3204:
3205:    This shall determine that.
3206:
3207:    They fight; TYBALT falls
3208:
3209:BENVOLIO
3210:
3211:    Romeo, away, be gone!
3212:    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
3213:    Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
3214:    If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
3215:
3216:ROMEO
3217:
3218:    O, I am fortune's fool!
3219:
3220:BENVOLIO
3221:
3222:    Why dost thou stay?
3223:
3224:    Exit ROMEO
3225:
3226:    Enter Citizens, & c
3227:
3228:First Citizen
3229:
3230:    Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
3231:    Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
3232:
3233:BENVOLIO
3234:
3235:    There lies that Tybalt.
3236:
3237:First Citizen
3238:
3239:    Up, sir, go with me;
3240:    I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
3241:
3242:    Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
3243:
3244:PRINCE
3245:
3246:    Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
3247:
3248:BENVOLIO
3249:
3250:    O noble prince, I can discover all
3251:    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
3252:    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
3253:    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
3254:
3255:LADY CAPULET
3256:
3257:    Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
3258:    O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
3259:    O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
3260:    For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
3261:    O cousin, cousin!
3262:
3263:PRINCE
3264:
3265:    Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
3266:
3267:BENVOLIO
3268:
3269:    Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
3270:    Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
3271:    How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
3272:    Your high displeasure: all this uttered
3273:    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
3274:    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
3275:    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
3276:    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
3277:    Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
3278:    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
3279:    Cold death aside, and with the other sends
3280:    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
3281:    Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
3282:    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
3283:    his tongue,
3284:    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
3285:    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
3286:    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
3287:    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
3288:    But by and by comes back to Romeo,
3289:    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
3290:    And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
3291:    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
3292:    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
3293:    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
3294:
3295:LADY CAPULET
3296:
3297:    He is a kinsman to the Montague;
3298:    Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
3299:    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
3300:    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
3301:    I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
3302:    Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
3303:
3304:PRINCE
3305:
3306:    Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
3307:    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
3308:
3309:MONTAGUE
3310:
3311:    Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
3312:    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
3313:    The life of Tybalt.
3314:
3315:PRINCE
3316:
3317:    And for that offence
3318:    Immediately we do exile him hence:
3319:    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
3320:    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
3321:    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
3322:    That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
3323:    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
3324:    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
3325:    Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
3326:    Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
3327:    Bear hence this body and attend our will:
3328:    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
3329:
3330:    Exeunt
3331:
3332:SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
3333:
3334:    Enter JULIET 
3335:
3336:JULIET
3337:
3338:    Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
3339:    Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
3340:    As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
3341:    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
3342:    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
3343:    That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
3344:    Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
3345:    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
3346:    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
3347:    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
3348:    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
3349:    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
3350:    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
3351:    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
3352:    With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
3353:    Think true love acted simple modesty.
3354:    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
3355:    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
3356:    Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
3357:    Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
3358:    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
3359:    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
3360:    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
3361:    That all the world will be in love with night
3362:    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
3363:    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
3364:    But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
3365:    Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
3366:    As is the night before some festival
3367:    To an impatient child that hath new robes
3368:    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
3369:    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
3370:    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
3371:
3372:    Enter Nurse, with cords
3373:    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
3374:    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
3375:
3376:Nurse
3377:
3378:    Ay, ay, the cords.
3379:
3380:    Throws them down
3381:
3382:JULIET
3383:
3384:    Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
3385:
3386:Nurse
3387:
3388:    Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
3389:    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
3390:    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
3391:
3392:JULIET
3393:
3394:    Can heaven be so envious?
3395:
3396:Nurse
3397:
3398:    Romeo can,
3399:    Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
3400:    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
3401:
3402:JULIET
3403:
3404:    What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
3405:    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
3406:    Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
3407:    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
3408:    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
3409:    I am not I, if there be such an I;
3410:    Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
3411:    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
3412:    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
3413:
3414:Nurse
3415:
3416:    I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
3417:    God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
3418:    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
3419:    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
3420:    All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
3421:
3422:JULIET
3423:
3424:    O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
3425:    To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
3426:    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
3427:    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
3428:
3429:Nurse
3430:
3431:    O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
3432:    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
3433:    That ever I should live to see thee dead!
3434:
3435:JULIET
3436:
3437:    What storm is this that blows so contrary?
3438:    Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
3439:    My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
3440:    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
3441:    For who is living, if those two are gone?
3442:
3443:Nurse
3444:
3445:    Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
3446:    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
3447:
3448:JULIET
3449:
3450:    O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
3451:
3452:Nurse
3453:
3454:    It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
3455:
3456:JULIET
3457:
3458:    O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
3459:    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
3460:    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
3461:    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
3462:    Despised substance of divinest show!
3463:    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
3464:    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
3465:    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
3466:    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
3467:    In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
3468:    Was ever book containing such vile matter
3469:    So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
3470:    In such a gorgeous palace!
3471:
3472:Nurse
3473:
3474:    There's no trust,
3475:    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
3476:    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
3477:    Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
3478:    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
3479:    Shame come to Romeo!
3480:
3481:JULIET
3482:
3483:    Blister'd be thy tongue
3484:    For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
3485:    Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
3486:    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
3487:    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
3488:    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
3489:
3490:Nurse
3491:
3492:    Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
3493:
3494:JULIET
3495:
3496:    Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
3497:    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
3498:    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
3499:    But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
3500:    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
3501:    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
3502:    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
3503:    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
3504:    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
3505:    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
3506:    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
3507:    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
3508:    That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
3509:    But, O, it presses to my memory,
3510:    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
3511:    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
3512:    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
3513:    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
3514:    Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
3515:    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
3516:    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
3517:    Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
3518:    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
3519:    Which modern lamentations might have moved?
3520:    But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
3521:    'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
3522:    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
3523:    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
3524:    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
3525:    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
3526:    Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
3527:
3528:Nurse
3529:
3530:    Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
3531:    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
3532:
3533:JULIET
3534:
3535:    Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
3536:    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
3537:    Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
3538:    Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
3539:    He made you for a highway to my bed;
3540:    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
3541:    Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
3542:    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
3543:
3544:Nurse
3545:
3546:    Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
3547:    To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
3548:    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
3549:    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
3550:
3551:JULIET
3552:
3553:    O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
3554:    And bid him come to take his last farewell.
3555:
3556:    Exeunt
3557:
3558:SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
3559:
3560:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE 
3561:
3562:FRIAR LAURENCE
3563:
3564:    Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
3565:    Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
3566:    And thou art wedded to calamity.
3567:
3568:    Enter ROMEO
3569:
3570:ROMEO
3571:
3572:    Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
3573:    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
3574:    That I yet know not?
3575:
3576:FRIAR LAURENCE
3577:
3578:    Too familiar
3579:    Is my dear son with such sour company:
3580:    I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
3581:
3582:ROMEO
3583:
3584:    What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
3585:
3586:FRIAR LAURENCE
3587:
3588:    A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
3589:    Not body's death, but body's banishment.
3590:
3591:ROMEO
3592:
3593:    Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
3594:    For exile hath more terror in his look,
3595:    Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
3596:
3597:FRIAR LAURENCE
3598:
3599:    Hence from Verona art thou banished:
3600:    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
3601:
3602:ROMEO
3603:
3604:    There is no world without Verona walls,
3605:    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
3606:    Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
3607:    And world's exile is death: then banished,
3608:    Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
3609:    Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
3610:    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
3611:
3612:FRIAR LAURENCE
3613:
3614:    O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
3615:    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
3616:    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
3617:    And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
3618:    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
3619:
3620:ROMEO
3621:
3622:    'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
3623:    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
3624:    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
3625:    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
3626:    But Romeo may not: more validity,
3627:    More honourable state, more courtship lives
3628:    In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
3629:    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
3630:    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
3631:    Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
3632:    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
3633:    But Romeo may not; he is banished:
3634:    Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
3635:    They are free men, but I am banished.
3636:    And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
3637:    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
3638:    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
3639:    But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
3640:    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
3641:    Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
3642:    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
3643:    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
3644:    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
3645:
3646:FRIAR LAURENCE
3647:
3648:    Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
3649:
3650:ROMEO
3651:
3652:    O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
3653:
3654:FRIAR LAURENCE
3655:
3656:    I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
3657:    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
3658:    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
3659:
3660:ROMEO
3661:
3662:    Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
3663:    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
3664:    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
3665:    It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
3666:
3667:FRIAR LAURENCE
3668:
3669:    O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
3670:
3671:ROMEO
3672:
3673:    How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
3674:
3675:FRIAR LAURENCE
3676:
3677:    Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
3678:
3679:ROMEO
3680:
3681:    Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
3682:    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
3683:    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
3684:    Doting like me and like me banished,
3685:    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
3686:    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
3687:    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
3688:
3689:    Knocking within
3690:
3691:FRIAR LAURENCE
3692:
3693:    Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
3694:
3695:ROMEO
3696:
3697:    Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
3698:    Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
3699:
3700:    Knocking
3701:
3702:FRIAR LAURENCE
3703:
3704:    Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
3705:    Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
3706:
3707:    Knocking
3708:    Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
3709:    What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
3710:
3711:    Knocking
3712:    Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
3713:
3714:Nurse
3715:
3716:    [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
3717:    my errand;
3718:    I come from Lady Juliet.
3719:
3720:FRIAR LAURENCE
3721:
3722:    Welcome, then.
3723:
3724:    Enter Nurse
3725:
3726:Nurse
3727:
3728:    O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
3729:    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
3730:
3731:FRIAR LAURENCE
3732:
3733:    There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
3734:
3735:Nurse
3736:
3737:    O, he is even in my mistress' case,
3738:    Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
3739:    Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
3740:    Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
3741:    Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
3742:    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
3743:    Why should you fall into so deep an O?
3744:
3745:ROMEO
3746:
3747:    Nurse!
3748:
3749:Nurse
3750:
3751:    Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
3752:
3753:ROMEO
3754:
3755:    Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
3756:    Doth she not think me an old murderer,
3757:    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
3758:    With blood removed but little from her own?
3759:    Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
3760:    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
3761:
3762:Nurse
3763:
3764:    O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
3765:    And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
3766:    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
3767:    And then down falls again.
3768:
3769:ROMEO
3770:
3771:    As if that name,
3772:    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
3773:    Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
3774:    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
3775:    In what vile part of this anatomy
3776:    Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
3777:    The hateful mansion.
3778:
3779:    Drawing his sword
3780:
3781:FRIAR LAURENCE
3782:
3783:    Hold thy desperate hand:
3784:    Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
3785:    Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
3786:    The unreasonable fury of a beast:
3787:    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
3788:    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
3789:    Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
3790:    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
3791:    Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
3792:    And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
3793:    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
3794:    Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
3795:    Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
3796:    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
3797:    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
3798:    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
3799:    And usest none in that true use indeed
3800:    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
3801:    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
3802:    Digressing from the valour of a man;
3803:    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
3804:    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
3805:    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
3806:    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
3807:    Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
3808:    Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
3809:    And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
3810:    What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
3811:    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
3812:    There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
3813:    But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
3814:    The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
3815:    And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
3816:    A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
3817:    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
3818:    But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
3819:    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
3820:    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
3821:    Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
3822:    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
3823:    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
3824:    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
3825:    Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
3826:    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
3827:    Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
3828:    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
3829:    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
3830:    Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
3831:    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
3832:    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
3833:    Romeo is coming.
3834:
3835:Nurse
3836:
3837:    O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
3838:    To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
3839:    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
3840:
3841:ROMEO
3842:
3843:    Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
3844:
3845:Nurse
3846:
3847:    Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
3848:    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
3849:
3850:    Exit
3851:
3852:ROMEO
3853:
3854:    How well my comfort is revived by this!
3855:
3856:FRIAR LAURENCE
3857:
3858:    Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
3859:    Either be gone before the watch be set,
3860:    Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
3861:    Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
3862:    And he shall signify from time to time
3863:    Every good hap to you that chances here:
3864:    Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
3865:
3866:ROMEO
3867:
3868:    But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
3869:    It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
3870:
3871:    Exeunt
3872:
3873:SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
3874:
3875:    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS 
3876:
3877:CAPULET
3878:
3879:    Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
3880:    That we have had no time to move our daughter:
3881:    Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
3882:    And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
3883:    'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
3884:    I promise you, but for your company,
3885:    I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
3886:
3887:PARIS
3888:
3889:    These times of woe afford no time to woo.
3890:    Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
3891:
3892:LADY CAPULET
3893:
3894:    I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
3895:    To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
3896:
3897:CAPULET
3898:
3899:    Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
3900:    Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
3901:    In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
3902:    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
3903:    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
3904:    And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
3905:    But, soft! what day is this?
3906:
3907:PARIS
3908:
3909:    Monday, my lord,
3910:
3911:CAPULET
3912:
3913:    Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
3914:    O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
3915:    She shall be married to this noble earl.
3916:    Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
3917:    We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
3918:    For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
3919:    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
3920:    Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
3921:    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
3922:    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
3923:
3924:PARIS
3925:
3926:    My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
3927:
3928:CAPULET
3929:
3930:    Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
3931:    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
3932:    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
3933:    Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
3934:    Afore me! it is so very very late,
3935:    That we may call it early by and by.
3936:    Good night.
3937:
3938:    Exeunt
3939:
3940:SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
3941:
3942:    Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window 
3943:
3944:JULIET
3945:
3946:    Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
3947:    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
3948:    That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
3949:    Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
3950:    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
3951:
3952:ROMEO
3953:
3954:    It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
3955:    No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
3956:    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
3957:    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
3958:    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
3959:    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
3960:
3961:JULIET
3962:
3963:    Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
3964:    It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
3965:    To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
3966:    And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
3967:    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
3968:
3969:ROMEO
3970:
3971:    Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
3972:    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
3973:    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
3974:    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
3975:    Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
3976:    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
3977:    I have more care to stay than will to go:
3978:    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
3979:    How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
3980:
3981:JULIET
3982:
3983:    It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
3984:    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
3985:    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
3986:    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
3987:    This doth not so, for she divideth us:
3988:    Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
3989:    O, now I would they had changed voices too!
3990:    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
3991:    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
3992:    O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
3993:
3994:ROMEO
3995:
3996:    More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
3997:
3998:    Enter Nurse, to the chamber
3999:
4000:Nurse
4001:
4002:    Madam!
4003:
4004:JULIET
4005:
4006:    Nurse?
4007:
4008:Nurse
4009:
4010:    Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
4011:    The day is broke; be wary, look about.
4012:
4013:    Exit
4014:
4015:JULIET
4016:
4017:    Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
4018:
4019:ROMEO
4020:
4021:    Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
4022:
4023:    He goeth down
4024:
4025:JULIET
4026:
4027:    Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
4028:    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
4029:    For in a minute there are many days:
4030:    O, by this count I shall be much in years
4031:    Ere I again behold my Romeo!
4032:
4033:ROMEO
4034:
4035:    Farewell!
4036:    I will omit no opportunity
4037:    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
4038:
4039:JULIET
4040:
4041:    O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
4042:
4043:ROMEO
4044:
4045:    I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
4046:    For sweet discourses in our time to come.
4047:
4048:JULIET
4049:
4050:    O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
4051:    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
4052:    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
4053:    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
4054:
4055:ROMEO
4056:
4057:    And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
4058:    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
4059:
4060:    Exit
4061:
4062:JULIET
4063:
4064:    O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
4065:    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
4066:    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
4067:    For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
4068:    But send him back.
4069:
4070:LADY CAPULET
4071:
4072:    [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
4073:
4074:JULIET
4075:
4076:    Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
4077:    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
4078:    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
4079:
4080:    Enter LADY CAPULET
4081:
4082:LADY CAPULET
4083:
4084:    Why, how now, Juliet!
4085:
4086:JULIET
4087:
4088:    Madam, I am not well.
4089:
4090:LADY CAPULET
4091:
4092:    Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
4093:    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
4094:    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
4095:    Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
4096:    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
4097:
4098:JULIET
4099:
4100:    Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
4101:
4102:LADY CAPULET
4103:
4104:    So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
4105:    Which you weep for.
4106:
4107:JULIET
4108:
4109:    Feeling so the loss,
4110:    Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
4111:
4112:LADY CAPULET
4113:
4114:    Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
4115:    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
4116:
4117:JULIET
4118:
4119:    What villain madam?
4120:
4121:LADY CAPULET
4122:
4123:    That same villain, Romeo.
4124:
4125:JULIET
4126:
4127:    [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
4128:    God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
4129:    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
4130:
4131:LADY CAPULET
4132:
4133:    That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
4134:
4135:JULIET
4136:
4137:    Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
4138:    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
4139:
4140:LADY CAPULET
4141:
4142:    We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
4143:    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
4144:    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
4145:    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
4146:    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
4147:    And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
4148:
4149:JULIET
4150:
4151:    Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
4152:    With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
4153:    Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
4154:    Madam, if you could find out but a man
4155:    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
4156:    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
4157:    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
4158:    To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
4159:    To wreak the love I bore my cousin
4160:    Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
4161:
4162:LADY CAPULET
4163:
4164:    Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
4165:    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
4166:
4167:JULIET
4168:
4169:    And joy comes well in such a needy time:
4170:    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
4171:
4172:LADY CAPULET
4173:
4174:    Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
4175:    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
4176:    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
4177:    That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
4178:
4179:JULIET
4180:
4181:    Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
4182:
4183:LADY CAPULET
4184:
4185:    Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
4186:    The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
4187:    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
4188:    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
4189:
4190:JULIET
4191:
4192:    Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
4193:    He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
4194:    I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
4195:    Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
4196:    I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
4197:    I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
4198:    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
4199:    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
4200:
4201:LADY CAPULET
4202:
4203:    Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
4204:    And see how he will take it at your hands.
4205:
4206:    Enter CAPULET and Nurse
4207:
4208:CAPULET
4209:
4210:    When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
4211:    But for the sunset of my brother's son
4212:    It rains downright.
4213:    How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
4214:    Evermore showering? In one little body
4215:    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
4216:    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
4217:    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
4218:    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
4219:    Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
4220:    Without a sudden calm, will overset
4221:    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
4222:    Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
4223:
4224:LADY CAPULET
4225:
4226:    Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
4227:    I would the fool were married to her grave!
4228:
4229:CAPULET
4230:
4231:    Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
4232:    How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
4233:    Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
4234:    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
4235:    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
4236:
4237:JULIET
4238:
4239:    Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
4240:    Proud can I never be of what I hate;
4241:    But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
4242:
4243:CAPULET
4244:
4245:    How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
4246:    'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
4247:    And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
4248:    Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
4249:    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
4250:    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
4251:    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
4252:    Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
4253:    You tallow-face!
4254:
4255:LADY CAPULET
4256:
4257:    Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
4258:
4259:JULIET
4260:
4261:    Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
4262:    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
4263:
4264:CAPULET
4265:
4266:    Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
4267:    I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
4268:    Or never after look me in the face:
4269:    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
4270:    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
4271:    That God had lent us but this only child;
4272:    But now I see this one is one too much,
4273:    And that we have a curse in having her:
4274:    Out on her, hilding!
4275:
4276:Nurse
4277:
4278:    God in heaven bless her!
4279:    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
4280:
4281:CAPULET
4282:
4283:    And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
4284:    Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
4285:
4286:Nurse
4287:
4288:    I speak no treason.
4289:
4290:CAPULET
4291:
4292:    O, God ye god-den.
4293:
4294:Nurse
4295:
4296:    May not one speak?
4297:
4298:CAPULET
4299:
4300:    Peace, you mumbling fool!
4301:    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
4302:    For here we need it not.
4303:
4304:LADY CAPULET
4305:
4306:    You are too hot.
4307:
4308:CAPULET
4309:
4310:    God's bread! it makes me mad:
4311:    Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
4312:    Alone, in company, still my care hath been
4313:    To have her match'd: and having now provided
4314:    A gentleman of noble parentage,
4315:    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
4316:    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
4317:    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
4318:    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
4319:    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
4320:    To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
4321:    I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
4322:    But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
4323:    Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
4324:    Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
4325:    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
4326:    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
4327:    And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
4328:    the streets,
4329:    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
4330:    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
4331:    Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
4332:
4333:    Exit
4334:
4335:JULIET
4336:
4337:    Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
4338:    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
4339:    O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
4340:    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
4341:    Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
4342:    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
4343:
4344:LADY CAPULET
4345:
4346:    Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
4347:    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
4348:
4349:    Exit
4350:
4351:JULIET
4352:
4353:    O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
4354:    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
4355:    How shall that faith return again to earth,
4356:    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
4357:    By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
4358:    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
4359:    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
4360:    What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
4361:    Some comfort, nurse.
4362:
4363:Nurse
4364:
4365:    Faith, here it is.
4366:    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
4367:    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
4368:    Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
4369:    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
4370:    I think it best you married with the county.
4371:    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
4372:    Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
4373:    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
4374:    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
4375:    I think you are happy in this second match,
4376:    For it excels your first: or if it did not,
4377:    Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
4378:    As living here and you no use of him.
4379:
4380:JULIET
4381:
4382:    Speakest thou from thy heart?
4383:
4384:Nurse
4385:
4386:    And from my soul too;
4387:    Or else beshrew them both.
4388:
4389:JULIET
4390:
4391:    Amen!
4392:
4393:Nurse
4394:
4395:    What?
4396:
4397:JULIET
4398:
4399:    Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
4400:    Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
4401:    Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
4402:    To make confession and to be absolved.
4403:
4404:Nurse
4405:
4406:    Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
4407:
4408:    Exit
4409:
4410:JULIET
4411:
4412:    Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
4413:    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
4414:    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
4415:    Which she hath praised him with above compare
4416:    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
4417:    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
4418:    I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
4419:    If all else fail, myself have power to die.
4420:
4421:    Exit
4422:
4423:ACT IV
4424:SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
4425:
4426:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS 
4427:
4428:FRIAR LAURENCE
4429:
4430:    On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
4431:
4432:PARIS
4433:
4434:    My father Capulet will have it so;
4435:    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
4436:
4437:FRIAR LAURENCE
4438:
4439:    You say you do not know the lady's mind:
4440:    Uneven is the course, I like it not.
4441:
4442:PARIS
4443:
4444:    Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
4445:    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
4446:    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
4447:    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
4448:    That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
4449:    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
4450:    To stop the inundation of her tears;
4451:    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
4452:    May be put from her by society:
4453:    Now do you know the reason of this haste.
4454:
4455:FRIAR LAURENCE
4456:
4457:    [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
4458:    Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
4459:
4460:    Enter JULIET
4461:
4462:PARIS
4463:
4464:    Happily met, my lady and my wife!
4465:
4466:JULIET
4467:
4468:    That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
4469:
4470:PARIS
4471:
4472:    That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
4473:
4474:JULIET
4475:
4476:    What must be shall be.
4477:
4478:FRIAR LAURENCE
4479:
4480:    That's a certain text.
4481:
4482:PARIS
4483:
4484:    Come you to make confession to this father?
4485:
4486:JULIET
4487:
4488:    To answer that, I should confess to you.
4489:
4490:PARIS
4491:
4492:    Do not deny to him that you love me.
4493:
4494:JULIET
4495:
4496:    I will confess to you that I love him.
4497:
4498:PARIS
4499:
4500:    So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
4501:
4502:JULIET
4503:
4504:    If I do so, it will be of more price,
4505:    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
4506:
4507:PARIS
4508:
4509:    Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
4510:
4511:JULIET
4512:
4513:    The tears have got small victory by that;
4514:    For it was bad enough before their spite.
4515:
4516:PARIS
4517:
4518:    Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
4519:
4520:JULIET
4521:
4522:    That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
4523:    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
4524:
4525:PARIS
4526:
4527:    Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
4528:
4529:JULIET
4530:
4531:    It may be so, for it is not mine own.
4532:    Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
4533:    Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
4534:
4535:FRIAR LAURENCE
4536:
4537:    My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
4538:    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
4539:
4540:PARIS
4541:
4542:    God shield I should disturb devotion!
4543:    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
4544:    Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
4545:
4546:    Exit
4547:
4548:JULIET
4549:
4550:    O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
4551:    Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
4552:
4553:FRIAR LAURENCE
4554:
4555:    Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
4556:    It strains me past the compass of my wits:
4557:    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
4558:    On Thursday next be married to this county.
4559:
4560:JULIET
4561:
4562:    Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
4563:    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
4564:    If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
4565:    Do thou but call my resolution wise,
4566:    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
4567:    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
4568:    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
4569:    Shall be the label to another deed,
4570:    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
4571:    Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
4572:    Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
4573:    Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
4574:    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
4575:    Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
4576:    Which the commission of thy years and art
4577:    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
4578:    Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
4579:    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
4580:
4581:FRIAR LAURENCE
4582:
4583:    Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
4584:    Which craves as desperate an execution.
4585:    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
4586:    If, rather than to marry County Paris,
4587:    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
4588:    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
4589:    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
4590:    That copest with death himself to scape from it:
4591:    And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
4592:
4593:JULIET
4594:
4595:    O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
4596:    From off the battlements of yonder tower;
4597:    Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
4598:    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
4599:    Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
4600:    O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
4601:    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
4602:    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
4603:    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
4604:    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
4605:    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
4606:    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
4607:
4608:FRIAR LAURENCE
4609:
4610:    Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
4611:    To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
4612:    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
4613:    Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
4614:    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
4615:    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
4616:    When presently through all thy veins shall run
4617:    A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
4618:    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
4619:    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
4620:    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
4621:    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
4622:    Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
4623:    Each part, deprived of supple government,
4624:    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
4625:    And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
4626:    Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
4627:    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
4628:    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
4629:    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
4630:    Then, as the manner of our country is,
4631:    In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
4632:    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
4633:    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
4634:    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
4635:    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
4636:    And hither shall he come: and he and I
4637:    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
4638:    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
4639:    And this shall free thee from this present shame;
4640:    If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
4641:    Abate thy valour in the acting it.
4642:
4643:JULIET
4644:
4645:    Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
4646:
4647:FRIAR LAURENCE
4648:
4649:    Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
4650:    In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
4651:    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
4652:
4653:JULIET
4654:
4655:    Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
4656:    Farewell, dear father!
4657:
4658:    Exeunt
4659:
4660:SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
4661:
4662:    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen 
4663:
4664:CAPULET
4665:
4666:    So many guests invite as here are writ.
4667:
4668:    Exit First Servant
4669:    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
4670:
4671:Second Servant
4672:
4673:    You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
4674:    can lick their fingers.
4675:
4676:CAPULET
4677:
4678:    How canst thou try them so?
4679:
4680:Second Servant
4681:
4682:    Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
4683:    own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
4684:    fingers goes not with me.
4685:
4686:CAPULET
4687:
4688:    Go, be gone.
4689:
4690:    Exit Second Servant
4691:    We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
4692:    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
4693:
4694:Nurse
4695:
4696:    Ay, forsooth.
4697:
4698:CAPULET
4699:
4700:    Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
4701:    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
4702:
4703:Nurse
4704:
4705:    See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
4706:
4707:    Enter JULIET
4708:
4709:CAPULET
4710:
4711:    How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
4712:
4713:JULIET
4714:
4715:    Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
4716:    Of disobedient opposition
4717:    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
4718:    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
4719:    And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
4720:    Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
4721:
4722:CAPULET
4723:
4724:    Send for the county; go tell him of this:
4725:    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
4726:
4727:JULIET
4728:
4729:    I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
4730:    And gave him what becomed love I might,
4731:    Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
4732:
4733:CAPULET
4734:
4735:    Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
4736:    This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
4737:    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
4738:    Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
4739:    Our whole city is much bound to him.
4740:
4741:JULIET
4742:
4743:    Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
4744:    To help me sort such needful ornaments
4745:    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
4746:
4747:LADY CAPULET
4748:
4749:    No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
4750:
4751:CAPULET
4752:
4753:    Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
4754:
4755:    Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
4756:
4757:LADY CAPULET
4758:
4759:    We shall be short in our provision:
4760:    'Tis now near night.
4761:
4762:CAPULET
4763:
4764:    Tush, I will stir about,
4765:    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
4766:    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
4767:    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
4768:    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
4769:    They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
4770:    To County Paris, to prepare him up
4771:    Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
4772:    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
4773:
4774:    Exeunt
4775:
4776:SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
4777:
4778:    Enter JULIET and Nurse 
4779:
4780:JULIET
4781:
4782:    Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
4783:    I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
4784:    For I have need of many orisons
4785:    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
4786:    Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
4787:
4788:    Enter LADY CAPULET
4789:
4790:LADY CAPULET
4791:
4792:    What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
4793:
4794:JULIET
4795:
4796:    No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
4797:    As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
4798:    So please you, let me now be left alone,
4799:    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
4800:    For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
4801:    In this so sudden business.
4802:
4803:LADY CAPULET
4804:
4805:    Good night:
4806:    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
4807:
4808:    Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
4809:
4810:JULIET
4811:
4812:    Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
4813:    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
4814:    That almost freezes up the heat of life:
4815:    I'll call them back again to comfort me:
4816:    Nurse! What should she do here?
4817:    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
4818:    Come, vial.
4819:    What if this mixture do not work at all?
4820:    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
4821:    No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
4822:
4823:    Laying down her dagger
4824:    What if it be a poison, which the friar
4825:    Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
4826:    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
4827:    Because he married me before to Romeo?
4828:    I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
4829:    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
4830:    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
4831:    I wake before the time that Romeo
4832:    Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
4833:    Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
4834:    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
4835:    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
4836:    Or, if I live, is it not very like,
4837:    The horrible conceit of death and night,
4838:    Together with the terror of the place,--
4839:    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
4840:    Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
4841:    Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
4842:    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
4843:    Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
4844:    At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
4845:    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
4846:    So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
4847:    And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
4848:    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
4849:    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
4850:    Environed with all these hideous fears?
4851:    And madly play with my forefather's joints?
4852:    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
4853:    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
4854:    As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
4855:    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
4856:    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
4857:    Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
4858:    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

4882:
4883:Nurse
4884:
4885:    Go, you cot-quean, go,
4886:    Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
4887:    For this night's watching.
4888:
4889:CAPULET
4890:
4891:    No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
4892:    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
4893:
4894:LADY CAPULET
4895:
4896:    Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
4897:    But I will watch you from such watching now.

4923:    I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
4924:    And never trouble Peter for the matter.

4933:    For so he said he would: I hear him near.

4955:    What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
4956:    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
4957:    The County Paris hath set up his rest,
4958:    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
4959:    Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
4960:    I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
4961:    Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
4962:    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?

5012:    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
5013:    Life and these lips have long been separated:
5014:    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
5015:    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

5022:
5023:    O woful time!
5024:
5025:CAPULET
5026:
5027:    Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
5028:    Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

5031:
5032:FRIAR LAURENCE
5033:
5034:    Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
5035:
5036:CAPULET
5037:
5038:    Ready to go, but never to return.
5039:    O son! the night before thy wedding-day
5040:    Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
5041:    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
5042:    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
5043:    My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
5044:    And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
5045:
5046:PARIS
5047:
5048:    Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
5049:    And doth it give me such a sight as this?
5050:
5051:LADY CAPULET
5052:
5053:    Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
5054:    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
5055:    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
5056:    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
5057:    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
5058:    And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
5059:
5060:Nurse
5061:
5062:    O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
5063:    Most lamentable day, most woful day,
5064:    That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
5065:    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
5066:    Never was seen so black a day as this:
5067:    O woful day, O woful day!
5068:
5069:PARIS
5070:
5071:    Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
5072:    Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
5073:    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
5074:    O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
5075:
5076:CAPULET
5077:
5078:    Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
5079:    Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
5080:    To murder, murder our solemnity?
5081:    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
5082:    Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
5083:    And with my child my joys are buried.
5084:
5085:FRIAR LAURENCE
5086:
5087:    Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
5088:    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
5089:    Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
5090:    And all the better is it for the maid:
5091:    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
5092:    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
5093:    The most you sought was her promotion;
5094:    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
5095:    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
5096:    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
5097:    O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
5098:    That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
5099:    She's not well married that lives married long;
5100:    But she's best married that dies married young.
5101:    Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
5102:    On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
5103:    In all her best array bear her to church:
5104:    For though fond nature bids us an lament,
5105:    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
5106:
5107:CAPULET
5108:
5109:    All things that we ordained festival,
5110:    Turn from their office to black funeral;
5111:    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
5112:    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
5113:    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
5114:    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
5115:    And all things change them to the contrary.
5116:
5117:FRIAR LAURENCE
5118:
5119:    Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
5120:    And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
5121:    To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
5122:    The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
5123:    Move them no more by crossing their high will.

5130:
5131:Nurse
5132:
5133:    Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
5134:    For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
5135:
5136:    Exit
5137:
5138:First Musician
5139:
5140:    Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
5141:
5142:    Enter PETER
5143:
5144:PETER
5145:
5146:    Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
5147:    ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
5148:
5149:First Musician
5150:
5151:    Why 'Heart's ease?'
5152:
5153:PETER
5154:
5155:    O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
5156:    heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
5157:    to comfort me.
5158:
5159:First Musician
5160:
5161:    Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
5162:
5163:PETER
5164:
5165:    You will not, then?
5166:
5167:First Musician
5168:
5169:    No.
5170:
5171:PETER
5172:
5173:    I will then give it you soundly.
5174:
5175:First Musician
5176:
5177:    What will you give us?
5178:
5179:PETER
5180:
5181:    No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
5182:    I will give you the minstrel.
5183:
5184:First Musician
5185:
5186:    Then I will give you the serving-creature.
5187:
5188:PETER
5189:
5190:    Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
5191:    your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
5192:    I'll fa you; do you note me?
5193:
5194:First Musician
5195:
5196:    An you re us and fa us, you note us.
5197:
5198:Second Musician
5199:
5200:    Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
5201:
5202:PETER
5203:
5204:    Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
5205:    with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
5206:    me like men:
5207:    'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
5208:    And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
5209:    Then music with her silver sound'--
5210:    why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
5211:    sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
5212:
5213:Musician
5214:
5215:    Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
5216:
5217:PETER
5218:
5219:    Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
5220:
5221:Second Musician
5222:
5223:    I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
5224:
5225:PETER
5226:
5227:    Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
5228:
5229:Third Musician
5230:
5231:    Faith, I know not what to say.
5232:
5233:PETER
5234:
5235:    O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
5236:    for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
5237:    because musicians have no gold for sounding:
5238:    'Then music with her silver sound
5239:    With speedy help doth lend redress.'
5240:
5241:    Exit
5242:
5243:First Musician
5244:
5245:    What a pestilent knave is this same!
5246:
5247:Second Musician
5248:
5249:    Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
5250:    mourners, and stay dinner.
5251:
5252:    Exeunt
5253:
5254:ACT V
5255:SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
5256:
5257:    Enter ROMEO 
5258:
5259:ROMEO
5260:
5261:    If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
5262:    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
5263:    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
5264:    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
5265:    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
5266:    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
5267:    Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
5268:    to think!--
5269:    And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
5270:    That I revived, and was an emperor.
5271:    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
5272:    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
5273:
5274:    Enter BALTHASAR, booted
5275:    News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
5276:    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
5277:    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
5278:    How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
5279:    For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
5280:
5281:BALTHASAR
5282:
5283:    Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
5284:    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
5285:    And her immortal part with angels lives.
5286:    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
5287:    And presently took post to tell it you:
5288:    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
5289:    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
5290:
5291:ROMEO
5292:
5293:    Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
5294:    Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
5295:    And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
5296:
5297:BALTHASAR
5298:
5299:    I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
5300:    Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
5301:    Some misadventure.
5302:
5303:ROMEO
5304:
5305:    Tush, thou art deceived:
5306:    Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
5307:    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
5308:
5309:BALTHASAR
5310:
5311:    No, my good lord.
5312:
5313:ROMEO
5314:
5315:    No matter: get thee gone,
5316:    And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
5317:
5318:    Exit BALTHASAR
5319:    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
5320:    Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
5321:    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
5322:    I do remember an apothecary,--
5323:    And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
5324:    In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
5325:    Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
5326:    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
5327:    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
5328:    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
5329:    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
5330:    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
5331:    Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
5332:    Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
5333:    Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
5334:    Noting this penury, to myself I said
5335:    'An if a man did need a poison now,
5336:    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
5337:    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
5338:    O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
5339:    And this same needy man must sell it me.
5340:    As I remember, this should be the house.
5341:    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
5342:    What, ho! apothecary!
5343:
5344:    Enter Apothecary
5345:
5346:Apothecary
5347:
5348:    Who calls so loud?
5349:
5350:ROMEO
5351:
5352:    Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
5353:    Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
5354:    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
5355:    As will disperse itself through all the veins
5356:    That the life-weary taker may fall dead
5357:    And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
5358:    As violently as hasty powder fired
5359:    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
5360:
5361:Apothecary
5362:
5363:    Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
5364:    Is death to any he that utters them.
5365:
5366:ROMEO
5367:
5368:    Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
5369:    And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
5370:    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
5371:    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
5372:    The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
5373:    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
5374:    Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
5375:
5376:Apothecary
5377:
5378:    My poverty, but not my will, consents.
5379:
5380:ROMEO
5381:
5382:    I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
5383:
5384:Apothecary
5385:
5386:    Put this in any liquid thing you will,
5387:    And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
5388:    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
5389:
5390:ROMEO
5391:
5392:    There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
5393:    Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
5394:    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
5395:    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
5396:    Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
5397:    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
5398:    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
5399:
5400:    Exeunt
5401:
5402:SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
5403:
5404:    Enter FRIAR JOHN 
5405:
5406:FRIAR JOHN
5407:
5408:    Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
5409:
5410:    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
5411:
5412:FRIAR LAURENCE
5413:
5414:    This same should be the voice of Friar John.
5415:    Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
5416:    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
5417:
5418:FRIAR JOHN
5419:
5420:    Going to find a bare-foot brother out
5421:    One of our order, to associate me,
5422:    Here in this city visiting the sick,
5423:    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
5424:    Suspecting that we both were in a house
5425:    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
5426:    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
5427:    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
5428:
5429:FRIAR LAURENCE
5430:
5431:    Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
5432:
5433:FRIAR JOHN
5434:
5435:    I could not send it,--here it is again,--
5436:    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
5437:    So fearful were they of infection.
5438:
5439:FRIAR LAURENCE
5440:
5441:    Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
5442:    The letter was not nice but full of charge
5443:    Of dear import, and the neglecting it
5444:    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
5445:    Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
5446:    Unto my cell.
5447:
5448:FRIAR JOHN
5449:
5450:    Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
5451:
5452:    Exit
5453:
5454:FRIAR LAURENCE
5455:
5456:    Now must I to the monument alone;
5457:    Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
5458:    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
5459:    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
5460:    But I will write again to Mantua,
5461:    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
5462:    Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
5463:
5464:    Exit
5465:
5466:SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.

5469:
5470:PARIS
5471:
5472:    Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
5473:    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
5474:    Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
5475:    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
5476:    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
5477:    Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
5478:    But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
5479:    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
5480:    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
5481:
5482:PAGE
5483:
5484:    [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
5485:    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
5486:
5487:    Retires
5488:
5489:PARIS
5490:
5491:    Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
5492:    O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
5493:    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
5494:    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
5495:    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
5496:    Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
5497:
5498:    The Page whistles
5499:    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
5500:    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
5501:    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
5502:    What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
5503:
5504:    Retires
5505:
5506:    Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c
5507:
5508:ROMEO
5509:
5510:    Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
5511:    Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
5512:    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
5513:    Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
5514:    Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
5515:    And do not interrupt me in my course.
5516:    Why I descend into this bed of death,
5517:    Is partly to behold my lady's face;
5518:    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
5519:    A precious ring, a ring that I must use
5520:    In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
5521:    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
5522:    In what I further shall intend to do,
5523:    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
5524:    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
5525:    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
5526:    More fierce and more inexorable far
5527:    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
5528:
5529:BALTHASAR
5530:
5531:    I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
5532:
5533:ROMEO
5534:
5535:    So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
5536:    Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
5537:
5538:BALTHASAR
5539:
5540:    [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
5541:    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
5542:
5543:    Retires
5544:
5545:ROMEO
5546:
5547:    Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
5548:    Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
5549:    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
5550:    And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
5551:
5552:    Opens the tomb
5553:
5554:PARIS
5555:
5556:    This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
5557:    That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
5558:    It is supposed, the fair creature died;
5559:    And here is come to do some villanous shame
5560:    To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
5561:
5562:    Comes forward
5563:    Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
5564:    Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
5565:    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
5566:    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
5567:
5568:ROMEO
5569:
5570:    I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
5571:    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
5572:    Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
5573:    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
5574:    Put not another sin upon my head,
5575:    By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
5576:    By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
5577:    For I come hither arm'd against myself:
5578:    Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
5579:    A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
5580:
5581:PARIS
5582:
5583:    I do defy thy conjurations,
5584:    And apprehend thee for a felon here.
5585:
5586:ROMEO
5587:
5588:    Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

5600:    O, I am slain!

5602:    Falls
5603:    If thou be merciful,
5604:    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
5605:
5606:    Dies
5607:
5608:ROMEO
5609:
5610:    In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
5611:    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
5612:    What said my man, when my betossed soul
5613:    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
5614:    He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
5615:    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
5616:    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
5617:    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
5618:    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
5619:    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
5620:    A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
5621:    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
5622:    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
5623:    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
5624:
5625:    Laying PARIS in the tomb
5626:    How oft when men are at the point of death
5627:    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
5628:    A lightning before death: O, how may I
5629:    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
5630:    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
5631:    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
5632:    Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
5633:    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
5634:    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
5635:    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
5636:    O, what more favour can I do to thee,
5637:    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
5638:    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
5639:    Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
5640:    Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
5641:    That unsubstantial death is amorous,
5642:    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
5643:    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
5644:    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
5645:    And never from this palace of dim night
5646:    Depart again: here, here will I remain
5647:    With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
5648:    Will I set up my everlasting rest,
5649:    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
5650:    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
5651:    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
5652:    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
5653:    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
5654:    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
5655:    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
5656:    The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
5657:    Here's to my love!
5658:
5659:    Drinks
5660:    O true apothecary!
5661:    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
5662:
5663:    Dies
5664:
5665:    Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade
5666:
5667:FRIAR LAURENCE
5668:
5669:    Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
5670:    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
5671:
5672:BALTHASAR
5673:
5674:    Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
5675:
5676:FRIAR LAURENCE
5677:
5678:    Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
5679:    What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
5680:    To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
5681:    It burneth in the Capel's monument.
5682:
5683:BALTHASAR
5684:
5685:    It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
5686:    One that you love.
5687:
5688:FRIAR LAURENCE
5689:
5690:    Who is it?
5691:
5692:BALTHASAR
5693:
5694:    Romeo.
5695:
5696:FRIAR LAURENCE
5697:
5698:    How long hath he been there?
5699:
5700:BALTHASAR
5701:
5702:    Full half an hour.
5703:
5704:FRIAR LAURENCE

5707:
5708:BALTHASAR
5709:
5710:    I dare not, sir
5711:    My master knows not but I am gone hence;
5712:    And fearfully did menace me with death,
5713:    If I did stay to look on his intents.
5714:
5715:FRIAR LAURENCE
5716:
5717:    Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
5718:    O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
5719:
5720:BALTHASAR
5721:
5722:    As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
5723:    I dreamt my master and another fought,
5724:    And that my master slew him.
5725:
5726:FRIAR LAURENCE
5727:
5728:    Romeo!
5729:
5730:    Advances
5731:    Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
5732:    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
5733:    What mean these masterless and gory swords
5734:    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
5735:
5736:    Enters the tomb
5737:    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
5738:    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
5739:    Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
5740:    The lady stirs.
5741:
5742:    JULIET wakes
5743:
5744:JULIET
5745:
5746:    O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
5747:    I do remember well where I should be,
5748:    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
5749:
5750:    Noise within
5751:
5752:FRIAR LAURENCE
5753:
5754:    I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
5755:    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
5756:    A greater power than we can contradict
5757:    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
5758:    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
5759:    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
5760:    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
5761:    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
5762:    Come, go, good Juliet,
5763:
5764:    Noise again
5765:    I dare no longer stay.
5766:
5767:JULIET
5768:
5769:    Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
5770:
5771:    Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
5772:    What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
5773:    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
5774:    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
5775:    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
5776:    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
5777:    To make die with a restorative.
5778:
5779:    Kisses him
5780:    Thy lips are warm.
5781:

5785:
5786:JULIET
5787:
5788:    Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
5789:
5790:    Snatching ROMEO's dagger
5791:    This is thy sheath;
5792:
5793:    Stabs herself
5794:    there rust, and let me die.
5795:
5796:    Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies
5797:
5798:    Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS
5799:
5800:PAGE
5801:
5802:    This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
5803:
5804:First Watchman
5805:
5806:    The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
5807:    Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
5808:    Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
5809:    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
5810:    Who here hath lain these two days buried.
5811:    Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
5812:    Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
5813:    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
5814:    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
5815:    We cannot without circumstance descry.
5816:
5817:    Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR
5818:
5819:Second Watchman
5820:
5821:    Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
5822:
5823:First Watchman
5824:
5825:    Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

5827:    Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE
5828:
5829:Third Watchman
5830:
5831:    Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
5832:    We took this mattock and this spade from him,
5833:    As he was coming from this churchyard side.
5834:
5835:First Watchman
5836:
5837:    A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
5838:
5839:    Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
5840:
5841:PRINCE
5842:
5843:    What misadventure is so early up,
5844:    That calls our person from our morning's rest?
5845:
5846:    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
5847:
5848:CAPULET
5849:
5850:    What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
5851:
5852:LADY CAPULET
5853:
5854:    The people in the street cry Romeo,
5855:    Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
5856:    With open outcry toward our monument.
5857:
5858:PRINCE

5865:    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
5866:    Warm and new kill'd.
5867:
5868:PRINCE
5869:
5870:    Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
5871:
5872:First Watchman
5873:
5874:    Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
5875:    With instruments upon them, fit to open
5876:    These dead men's tombs.
5877:
5878:CAPULET
5879:
5880:    O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
5881:    This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
5882:    Is empty on the back of Montague,--
5883:    And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
5884:
5885:LADY CAPULET
5886:
5887:    O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
5888:    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
5889:
5890:    Enter MONTAGUE and others
5891:
5892:PRINCE
5893:
5894:    Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
5895:    To see thy son and heir more early down.
5896:
5897:MONTAGUE
5898:
5899:    Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
5900:    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
5901:    What further woe conspires against mine age?
5902:
5903:PRINCE
5904:
5905:    Look, and thou shalt see.
5906:
5907:MONTAGUE
5908:
5909:    O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
5910:    To press before thy father to a grave?
5911:
5912:PRINCE
5913:
5914:    Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
5915:    Till we can clear these ambiguities,
5916:    And know their spring, their head, their
5917:    true descent;
5918:    And then will I be general of your woes,
5919:    And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
5920:    And let mischance be slave to patience.
5921:    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
5922:
5923:FRIAR LAURENCE
5924:
5925:    I am the greatest, able to do least,
5926:    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
5927:    Doth make against me of this direful murder;
5928:    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
5929:    Myself condemned and myself excused.
5930:
5931:PRINCE
5932:
5933:    Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
5934:
5935:FRIAR LAURENCE
5936:
5937:    I will be brief, for my short date of breath
5938:    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
5939:    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
5940:    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
5941:    I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
5942:    Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
5943:    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
5944:    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
5945:    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
5946:    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
5947:    To County Paris: then comes she to me,
5948:    And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
5949:    To rid her from this second marriage,
5950:    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
5951:    Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
5952:    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
5953:    As I intended, for it wrought on her
5954:    The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
5955:    That he should hither come as this dire night,
5956:    To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
5957:    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
5958:    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
5959:    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
5960:    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
5961:    At the prefixed hour of her waking,
5962:    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
5963:    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
5964:    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
5965:    But when I came, some minute ere the time
5966:    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
5967:    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
5968:    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
5969:    And bear this work of heaven with patience:
5970:    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
5971:    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
5972:    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
5973:    All this I know; and to the marriage
5974:    Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
5975:    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
5976:    Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
5977:    Unto the rigour of severest law.
5978:
5979:PRINCE
5980:
5981:    We still have known thee for a holy man.
5982:    Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
5983:
5984:BALTHASAR
5985:
5986:    I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
5987:    And then in post he came from Mantua
5988:    To this same place, to this same monument.
5989:    This letter he early bid me give his father,
5990:    And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
5991:    I departed not and left him there.
5992:
5993:PRINCE
5994:
5995:    Give me the letter; I will look on it.
5996:    Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
5997:    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
5998:
5999:PAGE
6000:
6001:    He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
6002:    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
6003:    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
6004:    And by and by my master drew on him;
6005:    And then I ran away to call the watch.
6006:
6007:PRINCE
6008:
6009:    This letter doth make good the friar's words,
6010:    Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
6011:    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
6012:    Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
6013:    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
6014:    Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
6015:    See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
6016:    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
6017:    And I for winking at your discords too
6018:    Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
6019:
6020:CAPULET
6021:
6022:    O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
6023:    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
6024:    Can I demand.
6025:
6026:MONTAGUE
6027:
6028:    But I can give thee more:
6029:    For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
6030:    That while Verona by that name is known,
6031:    There shall no figure at such rate be set
6032:    As that of true and faithful Juliet.
6033:
6034:CAPULET
6035:
6036:    As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
6037:    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
6038:
6039:PRINCE
6040:
6041:    A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
6042:    The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
6043:    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
6044:    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
6045:    For never was a story of more woe
6046:    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
6047:
6048:    Exeunt
